## Transcript

[Speaker 0]: Alright. 07:00 straight up. You are listening to Redwood Community Radio, KMUD

[Speaker 0]: Garberville,

[Speaker 0]: 91.1

[Speaker 0]: FM in HD one. KMUE

[Speaker 0]: Eureka, 88.1 FM in HD one. KLAI Laytonville, 90.3 FM. On the web, kmud.org

[Speaker 0]: and in Shelter Cove, we're at 99.5

[Speaker 0]: on FM translator K258BQ.

[Speaker 1]: Well, welcome to this month's

[Speaker 1]: 08/19/2022

[Speaker 1]: edition of Ask Your Herb Doctor.

[Speaker 1]: My name is Andrew Murray.

[Speaker 2]: My name is Sarah Johanison Murray.

[Speaker 1]: For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows before, you've just tuned in, it's a once a month radio show, third Friday of each month from seven till 8PM.

[Speaker 1]: It is a live show and we do open up the

[Speaker 1]: telephone lines from 07:30 to eight

[Speaker 1]: for listeners to call in with any questions about the show.

[Speaker 1]: So from 07:30 on, we'll be opening up the lines

[Speaker 1]: and the number to call is (707)

[Speaker 1]: 923-3911.

[Speaker 1]: Once again, from 07:30 until the end of the show, 8

[Speaker 1]: the number to call is (707)

[Speaker 1]: 923-3911.

[Speaker 1]: Again, for people who have perhaps have never listened to the show or have just tuned in, it's a once a month radio show where we are joined

[Speaker 1]: with the expert

[Speaker 1]: scientific viewpoint,

[Speaker 1]: not opinion, but scientific viewpoint,

[Speaker 1]: of Doctor. Raymond Peat, who I think has become

[Speaker 1]: pretty worldwide

[Speaker 1]: known.

[Speaker 1]: I know people in Europe and Scandinavia,

[Speaker 1]: have called in in the past and people from across The States have called in.

[Speaker 1]: We've had people from Down Under and we've had people from,

[Speaker 1]: South America even, calling in. So

[Speaker 1]: I appreciate all those people that do tune into the show either

[Speaker 1]: live or who listen to it on the archives and the Kmart archives are available for about two months post production. So,

[Speaker 1]: from now until about October,

[Speaker 1]: you can go to kmud.org,

[Speaker 1]: go to the audio archives,

[Speaker 1]: select the Friday night talk drop down,

[Speaker 1]: and go to the third Friday of the month to download,

[Speaker 1]: the show that's been recorded on that day.

[Speaker 1]: And also, incidentally, we have on our website westernbotanicalmedicine.com,

[Speaker 1]: a fairly exhaustive list from 02/2007,

[Speaker 1]: through to about 2020.

[Speaker 1]: But, I still have

[Speaker 1]: a good number of shows to put on that still hasn't been done. So excuse me for that.

[Speaker 1]: So once again, very pleased to, welcome Doctor. Pete to the show who I think has,

[Speaker 1]: somewhat,

[Speaker 1]: recovered from,

[Speaker 1]: some voice hoarseness due to the wildfires up in Oregon up there. So I know he was

[Speaker 1]: a little bit, a little bit croaky earlier on today. How are you doing, doctor Pete? Hi. Hi. Yeah. It comes from close.

[Speaker 3]: I

[Speaker 3]: probably should clarify

[Speaker 3]: what I mean by

[Speaker 3]: scientific

[Speaker 3]: viewpoint.

[Speaker 3]: I I am not like Fauci.

[Speaker 3]: I don't have the scientific

[Speaker 3]: viewpoint, but

[Speaker 3]: I think of the scientific viewpoint as

[Speaker 3]: a critical one,

[Speaker 3]: always thinking about

[Speaker 3]: the evidence and and what you're really

[Speaker 3]: implying.

[Speaker 3]: So it's a matter of criticism and thinking.

[Speaker 1]: Yeah. Well, I know you've always you're always able to back up what you say with either

[Speaker 1]: articles or reference articles

[Speaker 1]: or

[Speaker 1]: other information that is,

[Speaker 1]: bona fide published information.

[Speaker 1]: And

[Speaker 1]: very often, you'll point to various authors or publications that support

[Speaker 1]: what it is you're describing. So perhaps, I think just initially as we always do,

[Speaker 1]: just in case anybody listening doesn't know you, could you just give you an outline of your academic and professional background before we start the show? Yeah. I studied the humanities,

[Speaker 3]: first

[Speaker 3]: through a master's degree

[Speaker 3]: and then

[Speaker 3]: went back in 1968

[Speaker 3]: to the University of Oregon

[Speaker 3]: for a PhD

[Speaker 3]: in

[Speaker 3]: biology, basically,

[Speaker 3]: physiological

[Speaker 3]: chemistry,

[Speaker 3]: specifically,

[Speaker 3]: the,

[Speaker 3]: metabolic changes,

[Speaker 3]: physiological

[Speaker 3]: changes that happen

[Speaker 3]: in the reproductive system in aging.

[Speaker 3]: And

[Speaker 3]: so that's

[Speaker 3]: the the rich, more or less, a chapter of the dissertation

[Speaker 3]: that I,

[Speaker 3]: concentrated

[Speaker 3]: on

[Speaker 3]: the,

[Speaker 3]: what at that time was still sometimes called metaplasm

[Speaker 3]: or lupofuscum

[Speaker 3]: as a basic cause of aging.

[Speaker 1]: Okay. So the engineers just asked me to ask you if you could speak up a little. I can hear you quite well through my headset, but I'm not too sure the engineer can or if the levels are fairly low on the desk.

[Speaker 1]: So, yeah, if you can,

[Speaker 1]: if you're speaking on the phone, if you could just get as close to it as you can. So Doctor. Pete, I think what I wanted to

[Speaker 1]: expand

[Speaker 1]: with you is your

[Speaker 1]: your work

[Speaker 1]: and your,

[Speaker 1]: kind of discourse on lipo friskin. I know we've mentioned it in the past and we definitely mentioned relation,

[Speaker 1]: to polyunsaturated fatty acids, which definitely

[Speaker 1]: have, I think that

[Speaker 1]: the awareness from the public has exploded definitely in the last eighteen months,

[Speaker 1]: with publications

[Speaker 1]: coming out saying that they're not safe and that they are dangerous

[Speaker 1]: and that the whole thinking of the last three decades was quite erroneous and has actually resulted in quite a lot of,

[Speaker 1]: pathology,

[Speaker 1]: not just obesity and diabetes and other, you know, metabolic disorders, but all sorts of other,

[Speaker 1]: degenerative

[Speaker 1]: conditions. So, can I

[Speaker 1]: can I guess just start by,

[Speaker 1]: going over some basics with you,

[Speaker 1]: for these,

[Speaker 1]: so called essential

[Speaker 1]: fatty acids?

[Speaker 1]: So if you look if you look online, it seems to imply that they are only available from the diet. Is that correct?

[Speaker 3]: No.

[Speaker 3]: Some some very simple

[Speaker 3]: experiments make that

[Speaker 3]: really clear, but the

[Speaker 3]: the that amount of clarity

[Speaker 3]: in

[Speaker 3]: eighty years

[Speaker 3]: has hardly penetrated

[Speaker 3]: the beliefs

[Speaker 3]: about

[Speaker 3]: the the the facts

[Speaker 3]: because industry has

[Speaker 3]: found a motive

[Speaker 3]: in claiming that they are essential,

[Speaker 3]: where the

[Speaker 3]: the evidence is

[Speaker 3]: an extremely

[Speaker 3]: vague inferential

[Speaker 3]: type,

[Speaker 3]: but

[Speaker 3]: the evidence against it

[Speaker 3]: is as clear as,

[Speaker 3]: for example,

[Speaker 3]: you can grow

[Speaker 3]: human cells in culture,

[Speaker 3]: like for making

[Speaker 3]: specific proteins

[Speaker 3]: extracted from them.

[Speaker 3]: And

[Speaker 3]: if you're growing

[Speaker 3]: huge masses of cells in culture,

[Speaker 3]: you know exactly what they're being fed

[Speaker 3]: and you can feed them on a diet

[Speaker 3]: excluding

[Speaker 3]: absolutely excluding,

[Speaker 3]: fatty acids,

[Speaker 3]: especially the,

[Speaker 3]: unsaturated

[Speaker 3]: fatty acids.

[Speaker 3]: So you know

[Speaker 3]: they're

[Speaker 3]: multiplying

[Speaker 3]: enormously

[Speaker 3]: on a diet of

[Speaker 3]: no environmental,

[Speaker 3]: unsaturated

[Speaker 3]: fats. So,

[Speaker 3]: obviously,

[Speaker 3]: any unsaturated vat

[Speaker 3]: that they contain,

[Speaker 3]: is something that they have made themselves

[Speaker 3]: so that they can't be essential.

[Speaker 3]: The

[Speaker 3]: basic

[Speaker 3]: recognized

[Speaker 3]: evidence that we aren't getting environmental,

[Speaker 3]: linoleic

[Speaker 3]: or arachidonic

[Speaker 3]: acid,

[Speaker 3]: and are becoming deficient

[Speaker 3]: in these so called essential fats

[Speaker 3]: is to find that we are making

[Speaker 3]: something called Mead

[Speaker 3]: acid,

[Speaker 3]: which is

[Speaker 3]: an

[Speaker 3]: omega

[Speaker 3]: minus nine

[Speaker 3]: series

[Speaker 3]: of polyunsaturated

[Speaker 3]: fats

[Speaker 3]: and having a long

[Speaker 3]: saturated

[Speaker 3]: tail,

[Speaker 3]: just the opposite of fish oil.

[Speaker 3]: The n minus three

[Speaker 3]: has unsaturated

[Speaker 3]: groups

[Speaker 3]: within three

[Speaker 3]: carbons of the tip,

[Speaker 3]: and

[Speaker 3]: the type we make ourselves,

[Speaker 3]: the meat acids

[Speaker 3]: are

[Speaker 3]: the saturated

[Speaker 3]: fats

[Speaker 3]: extend,

[Speaker 3]: down to

[Speaker 3]: within only nine carbons at the end,

[Speaker 3]: and that makes them

[Speaker 3]: relatively

[Speaker 3]: resistant to external

[Speaker 3]: contact with oxygen.

[Speaker 1]: So that's that's kind of I think that's pretty important,

[Speaker 1]: what you've just mentioned

[Speaker 1]: about the

[Speaker 1]: erroneous doctrine of being essential

[Speaker 1]: and that they are,

[Speaker 1]: able to be manufactured.

[Speaker 1]: And that will bring out way more questions about the whole

[Speaker 1]: fish oil industry and pumping the narrative with the anti inflammatory

[Speaker 1]: dogma

[Speaker 1]: or doctrine

[Speaker 1]: of the essential fatty acids. I think what I just want to quickly ask you, haven't you said in the past

[Speaker 1]: that the placenta doesn't allow these fats to cross?

[Speaker 3]: Is that Oh, yeah. It's a very, very good filter.

[Speaker 1]: Right.

[Speaker 3]: Even when the mother is is

[Speaker 3]: eating

[Speaker 3]: fish and grains and

[Speaker 3]: Mhmm. Unsaturated fats,

[Speaker 3]: the general

[Speaker 3]: recognition

[Speaker 3]: is that at birth,

[Speaker 3]: babies

[Speaker 3]: demonstrate almost always they demonstrate

[Speaker 3]: making some of the

[Speaker 3]: anti inflammatory natural mead acid Right. Showing

[Speaker 3]: that they

[Speaker 3]: were assimilating

[Speaker 3]: very, very little of the,

[Speaker 3]: proof of an environment.

[Speaker 3]: And

[Speaker 3]: so

[Speaker 3]: they're defining

[Speaker 3]: the newborn baby

[Speaker 3]: as

[Speaker 3]: almost always

[Speaker 3]: essential fatty acid deficient.

[Speaker 3]: The formula companies

[Speaker 3]: argued that they need to add,

[Speaker 3]: basically,

[Speaker 3]: fish oil extract

[Speaker 3]: to baby formula

[Speaker 3]: to make up for the,

[Speaker 3]: the fact that

[Speaker 3]: the newborn brain

[Speaker 3]: shows evidence

[Speaker 3]: of deficiency of exactly those fats.

[Speaker 3]: And so they do add it to baby formula,

[Speaker 3]: and

[Speaker 3]: within a few days

[Speaker 3]: of reaching the

[Speaker 3]: grocery store,

[Speaker 3]: these fats are degrading

[Speaker 3]: Right. And becoming oxidized

[Speaker 3]: and toxic. Mhmm. And then after about a month in the store,

[Speaker 3]: they

[Speaker 3]: degrade even more, so you

[Speaker 3]: find less and less of the

[Speaker 3]: oxidized

[Speaker 3]: fish oil products.

[Speaker 3]: But,

[Speaker 3]: the the evidence is that

[Speaker 3]: what you're doing is feeding your baby

[Speaker 3]: rancid fish oil products,

[Speaker 3]: which are,

[Speaker 3]: toxic

[Speaker 1]: in many ways. Now haven't you also said that,

[Speaker 1]: they've done plenty of experiments to support the fact that babies that are fed on these formulas because of these EPAs and other,

[Speaker 1]: fatty acids that are in the formula, they can show that they have decreased,

[Speaker 1]: cognition,

[Speaker 1]: decreased awareness, and I think we've mentioned this in the past,

[Speaker 1]: to the

[Speaker 1]: comparison of the kind of quote unquote fussy baby, not one that's got griping colic, but is fussy and active and awake and just,

[Speaker 1]: you know, behaving like a normal baby. Yeah. Those studies were done

[Speaker 3]: over the last

[Speaker 3]: seventy or

[Speaker 3]: eighty years in,

[Speaker 3]: rats and dogs and other animals

[Speaker 3]: showing that in proportion to the amount of fufa

[Speaker 3]: in the diet,

[Speaker 3]: their brains

[Speaker 3]: are reduced in size

[Speaker 3]: and in learn learning ability

[Speaker 3]: after they're born.

[Speaker 3]: So the,

[Speaker 3]: deficient

[Speaker 3]: animals,

[Speaker 3]: without the proof in their brains,

[Speaker 3]: have bigger brains,

[Speaker 3]: are higher metabolizers

[Speaker 3]: all over,

[Speaker 3]: and,

[Speaker 3]: learn much faster.

[Speaker 3]: The the difference

[Speaker 3]: in in learning

[Speaker 3]: in the seventies,

[Speaker 3]: some studies said it was like

[Speaker 3]: like the average

[Speaker 3]: rodent

[Speaker 3]: deficient in proof

[Speaker 3]: of having

[Speaker 3]: something like a 140

[Speaker 3]: IQ,

[Speaker 3]: upper

[Speaker 3]: few few percent of of brain learning ability.

[Speaker 1]: Compared compared to his, EPA drugged

[Speaker 1]: siblings?

[Speaker 3]: Yeah. And if you look at the aging brain

[Speaker 3]: right from birth,

[Speaker 3]: all

[Speaker 3]: the animals that have been studied,

[Speaker 3]: the amount of PUFA in the brain

[Speaker 3]: does steadily

[Speaker 3]: increase,

[Speaker 3]: from the,

[Speaker 3]: so called deficient state at birth

[Speaker 3]: up until,

[Speaker 3]: a heavy overload state in old age and dementia,

[Speaker 3]: a steady increase

[Speaker 3]: in proof

[Speaker 3]: of concentration

[Speaker 3]: bound,

[Speaker 3]: interfering with cholesterol

[Speaker 3]: synthesis.

[Speaker 3]: But,

[Speaker 3]: as the proof of content of tissue

[Speaker 3]: increases,

[Speaker 3]: the heat production

[Speaker 3]: and metabolic

[Speaker 3]: energy of the whole animal,

[Speaker 3]: decreases in proportion.

[Speaker 3]: Right.

[Speaker 3]: So so the baby has

[Speaker 3]: extremely high overall

[Speaker 3]: oxygen consumption and metabolic rate

[Speaker 3]: supporting,

[Speaker 3]: that fantastic rate of learning Right. That is normal for a newborn.

[Speaker 2]: Well, excellent. So An interesting side note can you guys hear me? Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead.

[Speaker 2]: Okay. An interesting side note is I'm not someone who suffered from heartburn, but when I was pregnant, all three times, if I ate any

[Speaker 2]: PUFA

[Speaker 2]: rich animal fat, like a duck fat or a chicken fat or

[Speaker 2]: a pork fat,

[Speaker 2]: even just the tiniest little bit because I was avoiding that because I knew those contain PUFA.

[Speaker 2]: I because I wasn't eating any vegetables that contained PUFA, but that was the only time I would get heartburn is when I ate those fats or even just a little bit of those fats. So it was very easy for me to,

[Speaker 2]: see

[Speaker 2]: why I shouldn't be eating any kind of proof of fat

[Speaker 2]: when I was pregnant because I immediately got heartburn.

[Speaker 1]: Okay. So I think what we've outlined here you're listening to our hero doctor, Kami de Garboel,

[Speaker 1]: ninety one point one FM.

[Speaker 1]: And from now, or 07:30 rather, until the end of the show, you can call him with any questions,

[Speaker 1]: related to this month's subject of Lipopfushkin,

[Speaker 1]: Doctor. Raymond Peet joining us live.

[Speaker 1]: I think what I want to say right off the bat here is, first of all, that

[Speaker 1]: gosh, the essential fatty acid myth,

[Speaker 1]: has just been, again,

[Speaker 1]: destroyed

[Speaker 1]: and the whole

[Speaker 1]: gosh, and the word collusion gets banded around so much, especially during this cold COVID

[Speaker 1]: debacle.

[Speaker 1]: But the word collusion,

[Speaker 1]: in terms of the industries

[Speaker 1]: that are multi billion dollar industries and the fish oil industry is one of those massive,

[Speaker 1]: conglomerates

[Speaker 1]: worldwide pushing this stuff and all the academia pumping out the

[Speaker 1]: supporting

[Speaker 1]: evidence as it were with the, you know, study showing the anti inflammatory effect for your psoriasis

[Speaker 1]: or

[Speaker 1]: anti inflammatory effect for your asthma,

[Speaker 1]: of these so called essential fatty acids, which are not essential

[Speaker 1]: and the very fact that

[Speaker 1]: And I I don't have any problem bringing this out, but at the end of the day we're divine creatures and God made us in his image and the baby that is born in the mother's womb.

[Speaker 1]: The feeding mechanism selectively

[Speaker 1]: blocks

[Speaker 1]: the transport

[Speaker 1]: of these products. Now why is that?

[Speaker 1]: I think you got your answer right there. So,

[Speaker 1]: interesting. So let's carry on. Doctor. P, the fact the fact that these,

[Speaker 1]: n minus three and n minus sixes are not essential,

[Speaker 1]: but they are found,

[Speaker 1]: in many different foods,

[Speaker 1]: and I know you've always said nuts and seeds are number well, the fish oil is kind of number one, the most reactive or the most rapidly oxidizable,

[Speaker 1]: proofer, but nuts and seeds that we shouldn't be eating nuts and seeds because,

[Speaker 1]: maybe not so bad in their raw state if they're sprouted, for example, but when they make oil,

[Speaker 1]: from nuts and seeds, they never would have found that volume of oil within that nut or that seed to actually use it. So when they come up with canola oil, because corn does have a pretty high component of n minus three and six oils,

[Speaker 1]: the

[Speaker 1]: liquid oils that we are subjected to and have been for thirty, forty, fifty years,

[Speaker 1]: as a result of this huge industry, both number one,

[Speaker 1]: denying the fact that these essential fatty acids are essential because they're not. We can actually live without them and produce them ourselves spontaneously.

[Speaker 1]: But that the foods that have these are beneficial for us and we need to buy their products, especially the liquid oils that have been used and fish oil has become a multibillion dollar market.

[Speaker 3]: The nuts and seeds

[Speaker 3]: that produce the

[Speaker 3]: oils

[Speaker 3]: and the

[Speaker 3]: snakes

[Speaker 3]: and frogs and and fish

[Speaker 3]: that use

[Speaker 3]: them habitually and without any special problem.

[Speaker 3]: They don't think of themselves as food,

[Speaker 3]: but

[Speaker 3]: those oils are

[Speaker 3]: appropriate for

[Speaker 3]: manufacturing

[Speaker 3]: their own energy stores

[Speaker 3]: or

[Speaker 3]: to be

[Speaker 3]: obtained from their food

[Speaker 3]: because

[Speaker 3]: they live

[Speaker 3]: at

[Speaker 3]: a fairly low

[Speaker 3]: temperature,

[Speaker 3]: room temperature,

[Speaker 3]: and below, for example.

[Speaker 3]: And animal fats

[Speaker 3]: at room temperature tend to solidify.

[Speaker 3]: Right. And

[Speaker 3]: a snake with solidified fat

[Speaker 3]: just doesn't work very well.

[Speaker 3]: The same with the with the fish.

[Speaker 3]: If you're going to be have flexible

[Speaker 3]: active tissues,

[Speaker 3]: You need to have

[Speaker 3]: fats,

[Speaker 3]: that are

[Speaker 3]: liquid at body temperature,

[Speaker 3]: and so

[Speaker 3]: these

[Speaker 3]: fats which are

[Speaker 3]: appropriate for cold animals,

[Speaker 3]: If you put these

[Speaker 3]: fats into a very hot animal,

[Speaker 3]: that's when they're extremely

[Speaker 3]: unstable.

[Speaker 3]: High high temperature,

[Speaker 3]: high temperature plus the,

[Speaker 3]: the the fact that they are

[Speaker 3]: designed

[Speaker 3]: to to be

[Speaker 3]: very sensitive to heat so that they're

[Speaker 3]: flexible at room temperature.

[Speaker 3]: That means that

[Speaker 3]: you shouldn't eat them if you're gonna live at at 98 degrees Fahrenheit.

[Speaker 1]: Okay. So So Go ahead, Sarah.

[Speaker 2]: So what you're saying is that it's okay for the frogs and the snakes

[Speaker 2]: and the fish to eat these

[Speaker 2]: omega

[Speaker 2]: six and omega

[Speaker 2]: three oils because they're they're cold blooded,

[Speaker 2]: and they don't they're not going to heat those fats up to a high temperature and oxidize them. Where where it's weird because we're we should be around 98,

[Speaker 2]: 99 degrees Fahrenheit,

[Speaker 2]: we're going to rapidly oxidize those and turn them into free radicals. Is that what you're saying, doctor Pete?

[Speaker 3]: Exactly.

[Speaker 3]: In some studies, they decided to

[Speaker 3]: see how efficient

[Speaker 3]: as energy,

[Speaker 3]: sources,

[Speaker 3]: fish oil was for fish.

[Speaker 3]: Naturally, it has to be

[Speaker 3]: liquid enough to function

[Speaker 3]: at a cool temperature,

[Speaker 3]: but they

[Speaker 3]: added some animal fat,

[Speaker 3]: more saturated fat. So it wasn't quite so

[Speaker 3]: fish oil like to

[Speaker 3]: a salmon diet

[Speaker 3]: and then put them through an endurance test.

[Speaker 3]: And the

[Speaker 3]: salmon that were eating salmon fat

[Speaker 3]: didn't have the endurance

[Speaker 3]: that they would have if you gave them a little more saturated

[Speaker 3]: fat.

[Speaker 1]: Okay. So, you're listening to us here at doctor KVD ninety one point one FM,

[Speaker 1]: from 07:30 onwards. You're welcome to invite you to call in. Number is (707)

[Speaker 1]: 923-3911.

[Speaker 1]: So, Doctor. P, I think the, the focus and the thrust of the show being on lipofuscin,

[Speaker 1]: and its

[Speaker 1]: danger, its buildup,

[Speaker 1]: how it's

[Speaker 1]: virtually impossible to

[Speaker 1]: detox from it or remove it, gets bound up in neurons

[Speaker 1]: and is very much a

[Speaker 1]: aging

[Speaker 1]: causative factor and also one that is,

[Speaker 1]: I think well,

[Speaker 1]: well implicated in neurodegenerative

[Speaker 1]: conditions.

[Speaker 1]: And I think, you know, we can look at a little later things like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's disease,

[Speaker 1]: Parkinson's disease, dementia,

[Speaker 1]: and those other

[Speaker 1]: neurovegetative

[Speaker 1]: disorders. But,

[Speaker 1]: given that

[Speaker 1]: given that our diet is

[Speaker 1]: so broad and we have access to so many things and the health industry wants to point us towards the nuts and the seeds and the fish and, all of these things that are rich in these n minus three and n minus six oils.

[Speaker 1]: I know you've always supported

[Speaker 1]: a saturated diet and, using

[Speaker 1]: minimal,

[Speaker 1]: minimal starches too, but saturated or or saturated fats,

[Speaker 1]: as a prime source.

[Speaker 1]: In terms of your diet and

[Speaker 1]: the amount of foods that people

[Speaker 1]: do eat,

[Speaker 1]: what do you do you think it isn't over or not just overconsumption,

[Speaker 1]: but do you think that they should be consumed at all?

[Speaker 3]: I I think they should be avoided Yeah. As far as possible.

[Speaker 1]: Yeah.

[Speaker 1]: Avoided as far as possible. There you go. So,

[Speaker 1]: I think the,

[Speaker 1]: the basis of the Lipofushkin,

[Speaker 1]: would you would you outline

[Speaker 1]: your understanding

[Speaker 1]: of

[Speaker 1]: the process

[Speaker 1]: by which

[Speaker 1]: things like metal ions

[Speaker 1]: as well as stressors

[Speaker 1]: exert their effect on these N-three

[Speaker 1]: and N-six oils in the presence of our body temperature

[Speaker 1]: and and how destructive these things are. And then we'll go down the go down the rabbit hole of, you know, decreased age and dementia and all the other neurovegetative

[Speaker 1]: disorders.

[Speaker 3]: Starting in the nineteen thirties,

[Speaker 3]: to to explain

[Speaker 3]: why

[Speaker 3]: food got rancid,

[Speaker 3]: the process

[Speaker 3]: of breakdown

[Speaker 3]: of fats

[Speaker 3]: and how it works

[Speaker 3]: inside tissues.

[Speaker 3]: It was

[Speaker 3]: studied in various ways in including model systems,

[Speaker 3]: and people learned

[Speaker 3]: to manufacture

[Speaker 3]: something that

[Speaker 3]: looked and functioned,

[Speaker 3]: like lipofuscin,

[Speaker 3]: by reacting,

[Speaker 3]: for example,

[Speaker 3]: copper and

[Speaker 3]: vitamin c,

[Speaker 3]: iron,

[Speaker 3]: and just about any kind of fat

[Speaker 3]: and various biological

[Speaker 3]: components including nucleic acids

[Speaker 3]: and proteins.

[Speaker 3]: And you can see that the

[Speaker 3]: free radical process

[Speaker 3]: is triggered by the copper

[Speaker 3]: or iron

[Speaker 3]: and reductant such

[Speaker 3]: as

[Speaker 3]: vitamin

[Speaker 3]: c

[Speaker 3]: that attracts

[Speaker 3]: the

[Speaker 3]: oily

[Speaker 3]: materials, especially if they're unsaturated

[Speaker 3]: and causes a spreading,

[Speaker 3]: catalytic

[Speaker 3]: oxidative

[Speaker 3]: process that creates more free radicals.

[Speaker 3]: And so you can identify

[Speaker 3]: various things that are pulled

[Speaker 3]: out of tissues depending on which tissue you start the process in.

[Speaker 3]: If it's a liver

[Speaker 3]: and,

[Speaker 3]: you're under the influence of estrogen

[Speaker 3]: or alcohol, for example,

[Speaker 3]: the liver

[Speaker 3]: is going to produce

[Speaker 3]: lots lots of a porphyrin,

[Speaker 3]: chemical used for making heme,

[Speaker 3]: in energy metabolism,

[Speaker 3]: and that porphyrin

[Speaker 3]: will spontaneously

[Speaker 3]: amplify the formation,

[Speaker 3]: of the

[Speaker 3]: lipofuscant.

[Speaker 3]: And so some

[Speaker 3]: ready made molecules

[Speaker 3]: are great amplifiers

[Speaker 3]: of the process,

[Speaker 3]: but, that depends on the organ

[Speaker 3]: and the physiology of the organism at the moment it's happening.

[Speaker 3]: But it it varies with

[Speaker 3]: every organ

[Speaker 3]: and momentary

[Speaker 3]: conditions

[Speaker 3]: of the organ

[Speaker 3]: and the,

[Speaker 3]: the environmental

[Speaker 3]: availability

[Speaker 3]: of

[Speaker 3]: the various breakdown products.

[Speaker 3]: Tissue injury

[Speaker 3]: of any sort,

[Speaker 3]: releases

[Speaker 3]: fragments

[Speaker 3]: of the damaged cell material,

[Speaker 3]: and all of all of that

[Speaker 3]: fragmentary

[Speaker 3]: evidence of damage

[Speaker 3]: contributes to the formation

[Speaker 3]: of the lipofuscant.

[Speaker 3]: And

[Speaker 3]: at first,

[Speaker 3]: it's to be only in the soluble form.

[Speaker 3]: It can

[Speaker 3]: travel

[Speaker 3]: outside of cells,

[Speaker 3]: in between the cells

[Speaker 3]: through the connective tissue,

[Speaker 3]: through the bloodstream,

[Speaker 3]: back in the,

[Speaker 3]: cells in in different parts of the organism.

[Speaker 3]: And,

[Speaker 3]: some of it forms

[Speaker 3]: only as particles,

[Speaker 3]: in lysosomes

[Speaker 3]: or or mitochondria,

[Speaker 3]: or

[Speaker 3]: any

[Speaker 3]: particular part of the

[Speaker 3]: cell

[Speaker 3]: might might be where

[Speaker 3]: the majority of it starts.

[Speaker 3]: But it all depends on the situation,

[Speaker 3]: the conditions

[Speaker 3]: of that particular

[Speaker 3]: tissue. So it

[Speaker 3]: even though it's

[Speaker 3]: a very

[Speaker 3]: comprehensive

[Speaker 3]: theory

[Speaker 3]: of sickness,

[Speaker 3]: aging,

[Speaker 3]: and the

[Speaker 3]: degenerative

[Speaker 3]: process.

[Speaker 3]: It is so

[Speaker 3]: infinitely

[Speaker 3]: varied,

[Speaker 3]: that the

[Speaker 3]: ability to

[Speaker 3]: believe that it's happening,

[Speaker 3]: it's

[Speaker 3]: it has taken

[Speaker 3]: eighty years

[Speaker 3]: to pass from

[Speaker 3]: a fairly vague idea of what aging is

[Speaker 3]: to

[Speaker 3]: a recognition

[Speaker 3]: that

[Speaker 3]: it's a very powerful

[Speaker 3]: way of explaining

[Speaker 3]: disease degeneration and and aging.

[Speaker 1]: Now did you did you say that lipoproshkin

[Speaker 1]: can be soluble?

[Speaker 3]: Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 1]: Yeah. Okay. So it's not this insoluble material that is a complex of iron,

[Speaker 1]: protein and

[Speaker 3]: and sugar

[Speaker 3]: residues.

[Speaker 3]: Yeah. The smaller

[Speaker 3]: particles

[Speaker 3]: are form soluble

[Speaker 3]: medium sized molecules.

[Speaker 1]: So for example, when we okay. So let me just back up.

[Speaker 1]: When it comes to because I

[Speaker 1]: when I was looking at the Lipoproskin and its main,

[Speaker 1]: the main,

[Speaker 1]: areas that it's,

[Speaker 1]: deposited in,

[Speaker 1]: essentially, there's three categories, I think. With, nerves,

[Speaker 1]: cardiac muscle,

[Speaker 1]: I think it may have also mentioned skeletal muscle, and then skin. And I

[Speaker 1]: always,

[Speaker 1]: I always kind of relate lipoprotein with the age pigment that you see on, you know, the hands because they're visible with older people, for example.

[Speaker 1]: But you have said also that,

[Speaker 1]: that's kind of separate separate question. I'm kind of digressing a little bit. That the lipo fuskin can actually be present in bod in somebody in pretty high and dangerous amounts without actually showing itself on the skin. But let me just first hold hold the thought with that,

[Speaker 1]: to say that

[Speaker 1]: the lipid for skin itself, I I thought it was always the kind of complex between, like I said, the kind of iron or copper or zinc or, you know, some cation,

[Speaker 1]: and

[Speaker 1]: some kind of oxidized protein and then,

[Speaker 1]: sugars. And that it was

[Speaker 1]: insoluble when it got laid down into the nervous tissue, for example. And because

[Speaker 1]: it was complex the way it was, it was basically resistant to being broken down and removed. But you're saying that there is some lip of your skin at some point in time that is quite soluble and freely moving about. Is it able to be excreted at that point?

[Speaker 3]: Oh, sure. Yeah. Some of it shows up in the urine. Right. Okay.

[Speaker 1]: So,

[Speaker 1]: if that's the case then

[Speaker 1]: Okay. I'm just trying to think about the excretory pathways and seeing I was thinking about, you know, liver support and liver stimulants and things that would increase diuresis and improve kidneys function and removal of waste and that kind of thing. But,

[Speaker 1]: if that's the case then during the day,

[Speaker 1]: for example, if you're using things like bitters,

[Speaker 1]: in England, we just came back from being over there for a few few weeks, but bitters are very

[Speaker 1]: kind of European and English and people use bitters

[Speaker 1]: to stimulate bile and, you know, emulsify fats and improve digestion.

[Speaker 1]: Is there any mileage

[Speaker 1]: in supposing that these kind of bitters or

[Speaker 1]: aperitifs

[Speaker 1]: could have a positive effect in removing soluble lipofusculein before it gets

[Speaker 1]: converted or laid down into something that is less soluble and more permanent?

[Speaker 3]: Oh, I I think so.

[Speaker 3]: Accelerating

[Speaker 3]: your digestive processes in general Okay.

[Speaker 1]: Are gonna help. Right. I mean, not just using, for example, like you you always recommend cascara,

[Speaker 1]: as

[Speaker 1]: a laxative to

[Speaker 1]: decrease the transit time,

[Speaker 1]: but

[Speaker 1]: even those agents that would just improve liver function and

[Speaker 1]: digestion and excretion in general. Mhmm. Yeah. Okay. Alright. So let me ask you this then.

[Speaker 1]: What's the, what's the difference then between the,

[Speaker 1]: Lipofuskin that's found,

[Speaker 1]: both in endothelial

[Speaker 1]: plaque as a result of, you know, an atheroma that they say someone's died from because of the cholesterol that's there, but we know that that cholesterol is actually a protective mechanism under which that initial insult is is is visible in the forms of the lipofuscone

[Speaker 1]: on the endothelia.

[Speaker 1]: But how about also,

[Speaker 1]: the

[Speaker 1]: lipofreshkin

[Speaker 1]: that's found,

[Speaker 1]: as these,

[Speaker 1]: dewy these Lewy bodies that is,

[Speaker 1]: very prevalent, amyloid plaque that's prevalent in neurodegenerative

[Speaker 1]: disorders like Parkinson's

[Speaker 1]: or Alzheimer's,

[Speaker 1]: how how have they become insoluble and basically cause the demise of that person in a neuro vegetative way rather than just any of these? Things go into the composition.

[Speaker 3]: It depends on,

[Speaker 3]: the type of injury

[Speaker 3]: and

[Speaker 3]: exposure,

[Speaker 3]: the type of

[Speaker 3]: fat and the quantity that you're exposed to,

[Speaker 3]: as well as,

[Speaker 3]: the the natural

[Speaker 3]: factors

[Speaker 3]: such as the,

[Speaker 3]: hormone

[Speaker 3]: products. Mhmm.

[Speaker 3]: There is

[Speaker 3]: such variation

[Speaker 3]: that

[Speaker 3]: if it's going to be extremely,

[Speaker 3]: fat loving material,

[Speaker 3]: that means it's gonna

[Speaker 3]: stick in in your

[Speaker 3]: nerve cells primarily.

[Speaker 3]: Huntington's disease

[Speaker 3]: is very closely

[Speaker 3]: connected to certain types of

[Speaker 3]: of proof of derived

[Speaker 3]: lipofuscant.

[Speaker 3]: Each type of nerve

[Speaker 3]: malfunction

[Speaker 3]: associated with

[Speaker 3]: a a protein

[Speaker 3]: like

[Speaker 3]: like synuclein,

[Speaker 3]: each

[Speaker 3]: variation

[Speaker 3]: of lipofuscant

[Speaker 3]: molecule

[Speaker 3]: is going to

[Speaker 3]: affect which kind of nerve

[Speaker 3]: is affected

[Speaker 3]: in exactly what way.

[Speaker 3]: Interesting. So you can

[Speaker 3]: trace its history

[Speaker 3]: and even,

[Speaker 3]: you can

[Speaker 3]: work on unraveling the history

[Speaker 3]: because if you

[Speaker 3]: know that it's a

[Speaker 3]: a matter of a balance between

[Speaker 3]: how fast you're putting it in and how fast you can,

[Speaker 3]: remove it,

[Speaker 3]: the process of removal is very slow.

[Speaker 3]: But if you

[Speaker 3]: essentially

[Speaker 3]: stop

[Speaker 3]: the formation

[Speaker 3]: by

[Speaker 3]: stopping your

[Speaker 3]: excess intake

[Speaker 3]: of

[Speaker 3]: aluminum,

[Speaker 3]: iron, copper,

[Speaker 3]: and so on

[Speaker 3]: and of of,

[Speaker 3]: untetrated

[Speaker 3]: fats

[Speaker 3]: and other irritants,

[Speaker 3]: then you can

[Speaker 3]: reduce the formation of

[Speaker 3]: it almost to zero

[Speaker 3]: at which point

[Speaker 3]: that there's slight attrition,

[Speaker 3]: by way of vitamin e,

[Speaker 3]: can gradually reduce the

[Speaker 3]: the amount in the brain.

[Speaker 1]: Interesting. So do you think then now that

[Speaker 1]: fish oil, for example, would be a far more implicated

[Speaker 1]: fatty acid in

[Speaker 1]: the production

[Speaker 1]: of these Lipofo Fushkins over

[Speaker 1]: flaxseed oil, say, or

[Speaker 1]: corn or?

[Speaker 3]: Yeah. The the type of molecule

[Speaker 3]: is extremely variable,

[Speaker 3]: and,

[Speaker 3]: the

[Speaker 3]: some of the early studies with

[Speaker 3]: feeding a lot of fish

[Speaker 3]: to pigs and horses and dogs

[Speaker 3]: and and mink in particular.

[Speaker 3]: They

[Speaker 3]: identified something called

[Speaker 3]: yellow fat disease

[Speaker 3]: in which the animal's fat

[Speaker 3]: became a source of,

[Speaker 3]: dangerous inflammation.

[Speaker 1]: Let me let me hold you there for a second, doctor Pete. Accumulated

[Speaker 3]: in a in a form that

[Speaker 3]: created an intense

[Speaker 3]: degenerative

[Speaker 3]: inflammation

[Speaker 3]: throughout the the fat system.

[Speaker 1]: Let me let me hold you there for a second. We do have a a caller. So once again, you're listening to KMUD Garberville ninety one point one FM. From now until the end of the show date, the number to call is (707)

[Speaker 1]: 923-3911.

[Speaker 1]: Once again, (707)

[Speaker 1]: 923-3911.

[Speaker 1]: So let's take this caller. Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from? What's your question? Yes. I'm coming from, Garberville, California. My question is,

[Speaker 4]: as a general rule, I love the organic coconut milk,

[Speaker 4]: and I'm wondering

[Speaker 4]: what its benefits are. And I'm also wondering what the what you would recommend as another type of nut milk that are an excellent product.

[Speaker 1]: Okay.

[Speaker 1]: So coconut milk,

[Speaker 1]: Doctor. P, I know you're not too into

[Speaker 1]: nut milks per se.

[Speaker 1]: What have you got to say about coconut milk?

[Speaker 3]: I'm not especially wild about it. Studies in

[Speaker 3]: The Philippines

[Speaker 3]: have found that

[Speaker 3]: people who cook with it

[Speaker 3]: frequently

[Speaker 3]: have a high incidence of breast cancer.

[Speaker 3]: Ouch.

[Speaker 3]: So I'm not sure

[Speaker 3]: about

[Speaker 3]: what what its actual contents are.

[Speaker 4]: Basically, what I'm asking is,

[Speaker 4]: to drink the coconut milk without heating it, just using it as a general rule in a cool

[Speaker 4]: basis of putting fruit in it, that sort of thing?

[Speaker 3]: If it's just

[Speaker 3]: the

[Speaker 3]: actual water,

[Speaker 3]: if you puncture

[Speaker 3]: an unripe coconut

[Speaker 3]: and get the water out, but what they call the coconut milk or cream

[Speaker 3]: is a manufactured

[Speaker 3]: process,

[Speaker 3]: where they grind

[Speaker 3]: up

[Speaker 3]: some of the solid material and and suspend it

[Speaker 3]: in the water,

[Speaker 3]: and that

[Speaker 3]: I don't think is safe.

[Speaker 4]: Okay. The other question was the the nut milks. What what ones do you recommend?

[Speaker 3]: I I I don't think there's such a thing.

[Speaker 3]: They can make any emulsion,

[Speaker 3]: that's white

[Speaker 3]: and liquid

[Speaker 3]: and call it a milk,

[Speaker 3]: grain milk or bean milk or

[Speaker 3]: not milk, but

[Speaker 3]: that doesn't have any nutritional

[Speaker 3]: value

[Speaker 3]: in a positive sense.

[Speaker 4]: Okay. The the third question was you're mentioning the the linoleic acid, which is one of the most fabulous ones you can put in your body, and we do do all of these under under ETs, under consume these,

[Speaker 4]: linoleic acids.

[Speaker 4]: What other linole what other related,

[Speaker 4]: acids would you highly recommend that we do consume?

[Speaker 3]: The coconut oil

[Speaker 3]: in itself

[Speaker 3]: has some

[Speaker 3]: real adaptogenic

[Speaker 3]: properties

[Speaker 3]: by interfering

[Speaker 3]: with the PUFA.

[Speaker 1]: And it's thermogenic.

[Speaker 1]: Obviously, it's

[Speaker 1]: saturated and so it doesn't have any

[Speaker 1]: side effects of being able to be converted into

[Speaker 1]: a lip of Fushkin product.

[Speaker 1]: And it's

[Speaker 1]: definitely a metabolism

[Speaker 1]: stimulator.

[Speaker 2]: Okay. I think the Hi. Can I, just try to clarify for that caller Yeah? That Doctor. P

[Speaker 2]: really only recommends coconut oil

[Speaker 2]: and not he does not recommend

[Speaker 2]: the omega three or the omega six

[Speaker 2]: or any nut seed oils

[Speaker 2]: or nut milk or seed

[Speaker 2]: or bean milk is what basically I think you were trying to say, doctor Pete.

[Speaker 3]: Right. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]: Okay.

[Speaker 1]: Alright. So let's let's move on.

[Speaker 1]: Say again?

[Speaker 1]: I'm really close to

[Speaker 1]: it. I'll be kissing it in a moment. Alright. That's it. Okay.

[Speaker 1]: I caught you saying a little while ago, doctor Pete, that,

[Speaker 1]: other reductants

[Speaker 1]: like vitamin c could drive,

[Speaker 1]: lipoprotein

[Speaker 1]: production in the presence,

[Speaker 1]: of, those n minus three, n minus sixes. Is did I hear that correct?

[Speaker 3]: Yeah.

[Speaker 3]: Too too much vitamin c

[Speaker 3]: easily

[Speaker 3]: activates

[Speaker 3]: the any stray,

[Speaker 3]: atoms you have of aluminum,

[Speaker 3]: iron,

[Speaker 1]: zinc, mercury and so on. Okay. So how does that how does that, how does that relate to,

[Speaker 1]: orange juice? I mean, and consuming large amounts of orange juice. I mean, obviously,

[Speaker 1]: following what you're following then that wouldn't be a problem. But if people are out there drinking lots of orange juice, but they're still eating,

[Speaker 1]: you know, certain

[Speaker 1]: certain products that would contain

[Speaker 1]: either of these oils,

[Speaker 1]: wouldn't that vitamin c there be

[Speaker 1]: a danger?

[Speaker 3]: Oh,

[Speaker 3]: sure. But there are so many

[Speaker 3]: chemicals

[Speaker 3]: other than vitamin c.

[Speaker 3]: The

[Speaker 3]: oranges,

[Speaker 3]: citrus fruit in general,

[Speaker 3]: grape juice,

[Speaker 3]: fruits fruits and vegetables,

[Speaker 3]: very widely

[Speaker 3]: contain

[Speaker 3]: the

[Speaker 3]: bioflavonoids,

[Speaker 3]: which are

[Speaker 3]: basically

[Speaker 3]: inside the cell.

[Speaker 3]: They are oxidants,

[Speaker 3]: and in the right quantity,

[Speaker 3]: vitamin c is an oxidant

[Speaker 3]: inside the cell Mhmm.

[Speaker 3]: In the healthy, noncancerous

[Speaker 3]: cell.

[Speaker 3]: Yeah. But I mean, you, just The the function of anti oxidation

[Speaker 3]: of of the bioflavonoids

[Speaker 3]: and vitamin c comes when you get the right amount in

[Speaker 3]: cells

[Speaker 3]: which

[Speaker 3]: activates

[Speaker 3]: oxidative

[Speaker 3]: processes,

[Speaker 3]: absorbing

[Speaker 3]: potentially

[Speaker 3]: stray

[Speaker 3]: electrons that would

[Speaker 3]: contribute to the vofuscant.

[Speaker 1]: Is there any way that you would say would be a sure way to get these pumped inside the cells then so that you'd have that ability there and then at the cell level? I have to use them in moderation.

[Speaker 1]: Okay.

[Speaker 1]: So,

[Speaker 1]: okay. So I just want to kind of get my head around the,

[Speaker 1]: because I frequently drunk half a gallon of orange juice a day, I mean, for months and months, all through the summertime for sure,

[Speaker 1]: especially when I'm working.

[Speaker 1]: So given given that that is a high a pretty a pretty good,

[Speaker 1]: source of vitamin c, I'm obviously not consuming any poofer at the same time because I kind of live on milk and orange juice

[Speaker 1]: during the summer months especially, but,

[Speaker 1]: you say in moderation,

[Speaker 1]: to have this,

[Speaker 1]: you're talking about having this spread out over time because I do sometimes I get into

[Speaker 1]: a spate where I drink in orange juice. I'll almost drink a half a gallon in one go sometimes. But,

[Speaker 1]: you're saying just the moderation side of it during the day would be a safe enough way to get it into the cells rather than having any,

[Speaker 1]: having any negative effect from it?

[Speaker 3]: Yeah. You're getting

[Speaker 3]: equally large amounts

[Speaker 3]: of the other pro oxidant

[Speaker 3]: flavonoid.

[Speaker 3]: Right. Okay.

[Speaker 3]: And so they are

[Speaker 3]: helping to keep the cell oxidizing.

[Speaker 3]: Yeah. But if you take,

[Speaker 3]: say five grams

[Speaker 3]: of vitamin c Right. Then you get this gigantic surge

[Speaker 3]: of reductive

[Speaker 3]: energy that throws cells

[Speaker 3]: in just the opposite direction

[Speaker 3]: of turning on

[Speaker 3]: the lipofuscum

[Speaker 3]: carcinogenic

[Speaker 1]: degenerative process. Right. This this is why you recommend orange juice and you don't you're not at all really behind vitamin c as a tablet because you also say that the manufacturing process for this is very, very spurious.

[Speaker 1]: Mhmm. Yeah. Okay.

[Speaker 2]: So basically, what you're saying, doctor Pete, is that if you're getting a half a gallon of orange juice, you might have quite a lot of vitamin c there,

[Speaker 2]: but it's also balanced by the biflabinox,

[Speaker 2]: the naringenin,

[Speaker 2]: and the quercetin, and the other antioxidants

[Speaker 2]: that are in the orange juice, so it doesn't cause a problem. The vitamin c is balanced and in the right

[Speaker 2]: ratio with the other nutrients. Yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 1]: So would you, would you condone the use of citrus bioflavonides?

[Speaker 1]: Because they've been around for a while now, and I've looked at them in the past, and I've wondered

[Speaker 1]: what what, bet

[Speaker 3]: In the purified

[Speaker 3]: form,

[Speaker 3]: some of those,

[Speaker 3]: can be

[Speaker 3]: reductants the same way and excess of vitamins you can. Right. Right.

[Speaker 1]: Alright.

[Speaker 1]: So it's probably more a case of getting,

[Speaker 1]: whole whole plant,

[Speaker 1]: sources rather than purified

[Speaker 1]: bioflavonoids.

[Speaker 3]: Yeah. I I think

[Speaker 3]: one bioflavonoid

[Speaker 3]: probably

[Speaker 3]: intensifies

[Speaker 3]: and works with the system in the same fruit.

[Speaker 0]: Interesting.

[Speaker 0]: Okay.

[Speaker 0]: So we had a caller that had really bad reception, so he relayed to me. He wanted me to ask you, why do you think that cow milk is okay for humans since we're the only species that drinks another species milk after being weaned?

[Speaker 1]: Okay. That's a very so very Southern Humboldt question, I think. I don't know if the person came from Southern Humboldt or not, but,

[Speaker 1]: Doctor. Pete.

[Speaker 1]: What was the first part of the question? The first part of the question was relating to milk and why is it that,

[Speaker 1]: we're the only species that drink another animal's milk. If,

[Speaker 1]: if it was so good, other animals would be drinking milk and,

[Speaker 1]: we're the only ones that do.

[Speaker 1]: I think that was the thrust of the question, wasn't it? Yeah.

[Speaker 3]: I I think it has to do with

[Speaker 3]: the size of our brain and our culture

[Speaker 3]: that

[Speaker 3]: we have

[Speaker 3]: evolved on a high

[Speaker 3]: fruit diet, high carbohydrate

[Speaker 3]: diet,

[Speaker 3]: and

[Speaker 3]: in that diet,

[Speaker 3]: a very high calcium

[Speaker 3]: intake

[Speaker 3]: happens to be Mhmm. Sort of synergizing

[Speaker 3]: with,

[Speaker 3]: the other factors in the diet to

[Speaker 3]: optimize brain function.

[Speaker 1]: Okay. So,

[Speaker 1]: can I ask you about vitamin e's protective

[Speaker 1]: antioxidant role? Because I know I've read a few articles that were talking about vitamin e offsetting,

[Speaker 1]: mitigating some of the effects

[Speaker 1]: of these N-three and N-six's and the formation of Lipofuschkin.

[Speaker 1]: But some

[Speaker 1]: of the symptoms suggest that really

[Speaker 1]: we have to take large amounts of vitamin C to have a beneficial effect. But what do you what have what have you seen,

[Speaker 1]: from any kind of standpoint of scientific

[Speaker 1]: experiment?

[Speaker 3]: The definition of

[Speaker 3]: vitamin e has changed

[Speaker 3]: radically,

[Speaker 3]: since the first studies

[Speaker 3]: in the nineteen twenties and thirties.

[Speaker 3]: It was originally

[Speaker 3]: thought of as a fertility

[Speaker 3]: extending

[Speaker 3]: anti estrogen,

[Speaker 3]: chemical,

[Speaker 3]: but then

[Speaker 3]: as the

[Speaker 3]: toxic

[Speaker 3]: effects of, unsaturated

[Speaker 3]: fats

[Speaker 3]: became identified,

[Speaker 3]: vitamin e

[Speaker 3]: lost its

[Speaker 3]: anti estrogen,

[Speaker 3]: clot preventing,

[Speaker 3]: heart preventing,

[Speaker 3]: mystique,

[Speaker 3]: and was

[Speaker 3]: shifted

[Speaker 3]: over to nothing but an antioxidant

[Speaker 3]: in the nineteen forties.

[Speaker 3]: It lost all of its,

[Speaker 3]: hormonal

[Speaker 3]: benefits

[Speaker 3]: to the public

[Speaker 3]: knowledge

[Speaker 3]: and became only an antioxidant.

[Speaker 3]: But but that has now changed back,

[Speaker 3]: and so it's

[Speaker 3]: coming

[Speaker 3]: to be recognized again that it's

[Speaker 3]: an anti inflammatory,

[Speaker 3]: estrogen regulating

[Speaker 3]: substance.

[Speaker 1]: What,

[Speaker 1]: what what kind of dose would you recommend daily for someone someone to use as a supplemental form of vitamin e just to get this antioxidant effect? And what is this?

[Speaker 1]: Because a mix tocopherols,

[Speaker 1]: have been come have been a kind of advertising

[Speaker 1]: campaign for some time in terms of listing exactly what took off or what was at present and, Something like twenty or thirty milligrams.

[Speaker 1]: Twenty to thirty only. K. Interesting.

[Speaker 1]: Alright.

[Speaker 2]: And how many sorry, Doctor. Beatt, twenty to thirty milligrams. How does that compare to the international units?

[Speaker 3]: Oh, now

[Speaker 3]: it's

[Speaker 3]: used instead of international units.

[Speaker 2]: So what but what would be the comparison? Would it be, like, a hundred IU? Or

[Speaker 3]: Yeah.

[Speaker 3]: Language

[Speaker 3]: has simply changed

[Speaker 3]: so that

[Speaker 3]: you can talk about the different

[Speaker 3]: forms

[Speaker 3]: in terms of milligrams,

[Speaker 3]: and

[Speaker 3]: it's recognized that they have their

[Speaker 3]: value as vitamin e

[Speaker 3]: regardless of

[Speaker 3]: their

[Speaker 3]: anorexin

[Speaker 3]: properties.

[Speaker 2]: Okay. But the what would be the

[Speaker 2]: twenty to thirty milligrams a day is what you would say would be a good

[Speaker 2]: supplement dose of vitamin e. How would that relate if someone has a product that is in international unit?

[Speaker 3]: Has has a what?

[Speaker 2]: You know, some of these vitamin e products are in international units, like, they'll say two hundred IU or four hundred IU.

[Speaker 2]: So how would the twenty what's the equivalent?

[Speaker 3]: Well, sometimes they're still talking in terms of the antioxidant

[Speaker 3]: value

[Speaker 3]: or the Oh.

[Speaker 3]: D alpha

[Speaker 3]: tocopherol

[Speaker 3]: concentration.

[Speaker 3]: For

[Speaker 3]: about twenty years,

[Speaker 3]: you could only

[Speaker 3]: refer to D alpha tocopherol

[Speaker 3]: as vitamin e potency.

[Speaker 2]: And not the gamma and the delta and the other mixed tocopherols?

[Speaker 3]: They they had to be overlooked,

[Speaker 3]: but now that effect is

[Speaker 3]: disappearing.

[Speaker 2]: Okay. So when you state twenty to thirty milligrams, you're say stating twenty to thirty milligrams of a mixed tocopherol.

[Speaker 3]: Yeah.

[Speaker 2]: Okay. Thank you. Okay.

[Speaker 1]: I know you'd said in the past, oh, look out. Is there

[Speaker 0]: Wanted I wanted to give a a brief public service announcement here, please. There's a, caller was quite upset that there's a couple of goats in the middle of the road by the airport. She said they're in the middle of the road and it's getting dark and she just wanted to upset anybody. If there's they belong to anybody, that's where they are. They're by the airport on Sproul Creek Road, two black and white goats.

[Speaker 0]: There you go. Thank you so much. Thank you.

[Speaker 1]: Alright.

[Speaker 1]: Very, very lastly, Doctor. P, I do appreciate you soldiering on through this. I can tell that your voice is giving out. But,

[Speaker 1]: just say one last thing about estrogen and we'll wrap up the wrap up the show for the evening. In terms

[Speaker 1]: of you've always talked about estrogen being inflammatory.

[Speaker 1]: We've had plenty of discussion about why estrogen is bad for you and how its counterpart progesterone is the anti inflammatory

[Speaker 1]: molecule, especially for women.

[Speaker 1]: But estrogen's

[Speaker 1]: inflammatory

[Speaker 1]: nature

[Speaker 1]: in terms of its effect on the N-three and sixes and lipofuscans formation

[Speaker 1]: is equivocal, correct,

[Speaker 1]: in terms of the destructive effects of,

[Speaker 1]: of estrogen?

[Speaker 3]: Yes.

[Speaker 3]: So so you can

[Speaker 3]: treat

[Speaker 3]: all of these things

[Speaker 3]: as synergizing

[Speaker 3]: either beneficial factors or harmful factors.

[Speaker 3]: The

[Speaker 3]: amount of PUFA,

[Speaker 3]: the amount of ionizing

[Speaker 3]: radiation,

[Speaker 3]: the exposure to heavy metals,

[Speaker 3]: and,

[Speaker 3]: each of the components

[Speaker 3]: is at least additive

[Speaker 3]: to the others.

[Speaker 3]: And,

[Speaker 3]: so

[Speaker 3]: if you

[Speaker 3]: do something to oppose

[Speaker 3]: any one of those,

[Speaker 3]: reducing inflammation,

[Speaker 3]: you're you're going to reduce

[Speaker 3]: estrogen exposure,

[Speaker 3]: rate of aging, and so on.

[Speaker 3]: Tissue fibrosis

[Speaker 3]: and inflammation,

[Speaker 3]: degeneration,

[Speaker 3]: aging and cancer,

[Speaker 3]: all of these,

[Speaker 3]: can be alleviated

[Speaker 3]: by

[Speaker 3]: suitable

[Speaker 3]: natural

[Speaker 3]: anti inflammatory

[Speaker 3]: things including

[Speaker 3]: carbon dioxide,

[Speaker 3]: progesterone,

[Speaker 3]: thyroid function, and so on.

[Speaker 1]: Okay. Well, thank you very much. Just hold it there, Doctor. Pete. I'll give out your information. Thanks so much for joining us. Okay. Thank you. Okay. So

[Speaker 1]: Doctor. Pete can be found online at www.raypet.com.

[Speaker 1]: And we can be found online,

[Speaker 1]: westernbotanicalmedicine

[Speaker 1]: dot com.

[Speaker 1]: I think what I wanted to bring out from the show was that

[Speaker 1]: the whole concept of these

[Speaker 1]: polyunsaturated

[Speaker 1]: fatty acids from many different sources of which some are touted as being health beneficial and good for us or they call them cholesterol lowering or

[Speaker 1]: blood pressure lowering,

[Speaker 1]: Many, many cases, this is completely erroneous.

[Speaker 1]: And not just that, but that there is actually something that we can do to mitigate

[Speaker 1]: the absorption and the permanence of these things, I wasn't even aware that some of these, this lipo fission can be soluble.

[Speaker 1]: I thought it just formed into these complexes fairly rapidly under the presence of iron

[Speaker 1]: cations or aluminum or zinc or other cations with the heat that we have in our body.

[Speaker 1]: They rapidly get

[Speaker 1]: converted into fairly insoluble products, but that's not the case. So definitely a good cause for those people listening out there from a herb perspective.

[Speaker 1]: And it's something that they've always done in Europe for a long time. Digestive bitters,

[Speaker 1]: hepatic stimulants,

[Speaker 1]: laxatives,

[Speaker 1]: all of these things

[Speaker 1]: will certainly be

[Speaker 1]: beneficial

[Speaker 1]: and actually be very a very good mitigating strategy,

[Speaker 1]: especially for people who've just found this information out and want to start switching

[Speaker 1]: their fat sources to saturated.

[Speaker 1]: The people that still think that fish oil is good for you, having listened to this show, I don't know how you can.

[Speaker 1]: It's not true, and it's definitely a lie. And

[Speaker 1]: it's an industry

[Speaker 1]: fighting

[Speaker 1]: to maintain a huge hold on a multibillion dollar industry.

[Speaker 1]: So yeah, there's things that can be done and stimulants,

[Speaker 1]: hepatic stimulants and bitters and aperitifs

[Speaker 1]: and all of these things that will improve your liver function and clearance of waste

[Speaker 1]: as well as your bowel function and preventing constipation will definitely have a bearing on you not absorbing these things

[Speaker 1]: by the same degree. And so therefore, it can only be beneficial.

[Speaker 1]: Anyway, so until the third Friday of next month,

[Speaker 1]: hopefully, Doctor. Pete's voice is

[Speaker 1]: better and the wildfires have

[Speaker 1]: calmed down. I'm not too sure how that works because they do tend to burn on for the whole summer, but without being negative on that.

[Speaker 1]: I wish all of you a very good summer. And

[Speaker 1]: until the third Friday of next month, my name is Andrew Murray.

[Speaker 2]: My name is Sarah Johanison Murray. Thank you very much for listening and joining the show. Thank you.

[Speaker 0]: Okay. Just one more time, we wanna remind folks that there are two goats right near the the airport on Sproul Creek Road, black and white. Black and white, and, they're in the middle of the road. So if those are your goats, that's where they are. Check them out. Make sure your goats

[Speaker 3]: goats are where they're supposed to

[Speaker 3]: be.
