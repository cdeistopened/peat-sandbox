## Introduction

Welcome to the January 21, 2022 edition of Ask the Herb Doctor on KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM, broadcasting from the Redwood coast of California. We're covering this month's subjects: MSG and cancer, continuation of estrogen and its progressively destructive effects, the induction of autoimmunity and cancer, and the link between COVID and MSG through their negative effects on the immune system.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you, good evening and welcome to January 21, 2022's edition of Ask your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Welcome to our show.

**Andrew Murray:** You're listening to KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM here from the Redwood coast of California, broadcasting nationwide and internationally. You're invited to call in with questions related to this month's subject of MSG and cancer and the continuation of estrogen and its progressively destructive effects and induction of autoimmunity and cancer. The number is 707-933-911. So from 7:30 until the end of the show, please call with any questions. Okay, so Dr. Pete, are you with us?

## Dr. Ray Peat's Background

tags: [[credentials]] [[biography]] [[reproductive physiology]] [[aging research]]

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us again as usual. Let me make sure you are fully introduced to the audience. Tell them about your background and expertise.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I had been a student of the humanities, teaching painting and English literature and various humanities subjects. I got interested in language and how the brain can accomplish such a thing as use language. I decided that the only way to make progress was to go to graduate school in biology and study the brain. In 1968 I went back to the University of Oregon and quickly found that the nerve biology section of the department was very dogmatic and cared more about their theories than the actual experimental evidence. I decided to do my dissertation on age-related oxidative changes in the hamster uterus, which I finished in 1972. That had a huge amount of information relative to brain function and thoroughly understanding what's going on in aging changes and how the organism redesigns cells. I've been working on those subjects ever since.

**Andrew Murray:** From a social perspective, I really appreciate your interweaving your artistic nature with a fluid understanding. You have a very fluid, plastic way of looking at things, and I know it's brought a very wide spotlight on a lot of subjects that we've covered. The archives that we've recorded with you probably for the last 14 years nearly now are going to be a living testimony to what's already been confirmed, though reluctantly by some industries.

## Herbal Perspectives on Estrogen Modulation

tags: [[estrogen]] [[herbal medicine]] [[bitter melon]] [[artemisinin]] [[tamoxifen]]

**Andrew Murray:** Before we get into the topic of MSG, I wanted to cover a couple of things from an herbal perspective surrounding estrogen and aromatase that I want to share with people. Last month I mentioned Momordica charantia, which is bitter melon, a cucurbitaceous vine bearing plant that has been used to block estrogen and has estrogen modulating properties. It's also an anti-diabetic plant that works with regulating blood glucose.

I also wanted to mention artemisinin, a component of wormwood, Artemisia annua, which contains antiparasitic, antimicrobial, and antiviral effects, but has also been shown to reduce the estrogen receptive function in breast cancer cell lines.

Additionally, tamoxifen may be useful in the treatment of immune mediated disorders, particularly those arising from aberrant helper T cell activity including allograft rejection, and has been used with some success in Crohn's. The induced shift away from cellular immunity represents a significant step in fostering a cancerogenic environment, which may limit the anti-cancer effects of tamoxifen and explain why tamoxifen is inferior compared to other anti-estrogens for preventing disease recurrence in early breast tumors.

## MSG and Excitotoxicity Overview

tags: [[MSG]] [[glutamate]] [[excitotoxicity]] [[FDA]] [[food additives]]

Monosodium glutamate is one of the most abundantly found amino acids in nature and is present in a heterogeneous group of foods as a flavor enhancer. It's issued as a food additive known as E621 in the form of hydrolyzed protein or as a purified monosodium salt.

Very early on they were demonstrating the benefits of monosodium glutamate as responsible for increasing temperature, decreasing body mass, and decreasing production of fat tissues. However, this was primarily a sales ploy.

**Andrew Murray:** Early on, MSG was supposedly going to increase your metabolism and burn fat. But you've been looking at monosodium glutamate and its excitotoxic effects. Can you explain this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think the weight loss thing was just a sales ploy to sell the flavoring substance. In the 1970s, J.W. Olney found that when rats were fed just a little more than the amount that a person could normally eat in various artificial foods or added as flavoring, the brain was damaged in a certain way that led to lifelong obesity. The destruction of enough of the brain caused appetite to remain out of control and the metabolic rate wasn't sufficient to keep weight steady.

Over a period of several years, he did many experiments, including showing that the same sort of molecule—aspartic acid, aspartame, or variations—but as long as it was acting through the glutamate receptor or the aspartate receptor, it had this range of excitatory effects. One positive thing was that it made you seem more alert, but that alertness came at the expense of not having enough energy produced to meet the high energy consumption caused by the excitatory action of the aspartate or glutamate.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Isn't aspartame also like a fake sugar, like Splenda?

**Michael:** Yeah, Aspartame is aspartic acid with methanol and it degrades into methanol and leaves methanol in your neurons.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Aspartame is super sweet material, sweeter than saccharin, but the amount that is toxic is very small. Olney, among others in the late 70s was showing that the sudden appearance of a rising incidence of gliomas—malignant glial cell tumors, brain cancer—followed by a few years the introduction of foods that were loaded with everything from aspartame to MSG.

## Aspartame and Brain Cancer

tags: [[aspartame]] [[glioma]] [[brain cancer]] [[cell phones]] [[excitotoxicity]]

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cell phones have corresponded—if a person habitually holds their cell phone to the right ear, the incidence of brain tumors on the right of a particular kind has increased sharply since the use of cell phones. It happens that they are both causes of excitotoxicity. The electromagnetic field excites the cells and you need to provide energy to keep up with that or the cell dies.

Ongoing experiments show that when cells are endangered by such things as MSG or aspartame, if you intervene by giving them a super amount of sugar—glucose or other sugar—will save the neurons simply by feeding whatever is needed to keep up with the high level of excitation.

The excitotoxic conflict between unavoidable stimulation of excitation combined with something interfering with the oxidation of glucose applies to epilepsy, for example. If the cells aren't able to keep up their energy production and use with the excitation, the seizure gets out of control and damages the tissue.

Any cell that can be exaggeratedly stimulated can be rescued if you keep the sugar supply up. But if it isn't kept up, then that cell can become cancerous, can form brain tumors, or can just die, leading to dementia or various types of brain function loss.

## The Excitotoxic Mechanism: Cellular Energy Crisis

tags: [[cellular energy]] [[excitotoxicity]] [[glucose]] [[carbon dioxide]] [[lactic acid]]

**Andrew Murray:** This is like a kind of wasteful entropy. There's a lack of input of the energy needed to keep the cell going.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, and it's made worse by overlapping influences. It isn't just cell phone radiation and aspartame and MSG, but many different things all have that same function. Any stress—vibration, laser overstimulation, telephone overstimulation, or even simply glucose deprivation or oxygen deprivation—they all turn out to be excitatory.

The feeding of energy in the form of sugar has a sedative action that leads to turning down the degree of excitation and the harmful influence damage to the cell. When the cell perceives that it is not getting enough energy to meet the needs, one alternative is to try to go into hibernation to turn off its own needs for energy. Another universal basic type of reaction is the formation of histamine. When a cell is in desperate dying conditions, it forms and secretes histamine into its environment because the histamine will open up any closed blood vessels and get more blood delivered.

Estrogen is another of these short-term emergency things. Estrogen can activate the serotonin system and cool off the whole energy consuming apparatus. It can activate the histamine system and activates nitric oxide formation that opens up the blood vessels. It can activate heme oxygenase which breaks down heme. In the desperate condition, breaking down the heme will provide some antioxidant function, producing bilirubin and carbon monoxide. The carbon monoxide can serve as an antioxidant, moving the system into a torpor or hibernation.

## Protein Metabolism and Excitotoxic Amino Acids

tags: [[protein]] [[amino acids]] [[glutamate]] [[methionine]] [[dietary recommendations]]

**Michael (Caller):** My understanding is that the glutamate or the accent flavor is stimulating the umami flavor and a lot of high protein and other nutritious foods stimulate that too. How is it that the body is able to be benefited by eating like a nice high protein diet?

**Andrew Murray:** Yes, the hydrolyzed protein and the whey, the soy protein and a lot of those products are totally big sources of MSG. Dr. Pete, how about the flavoring side of MSG and its natural presence in the diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the natural state, protein is a rare delicacy for most animals. The urge to eat some protein is a definite survival urge. But when society provides lots and lots of cheap protein, people get in the habit of not being guided by their appetite and cravings, but just eating it because it's there and even because it's considered the most valuable food. People tend to overeat on protein after they're around the age of 20 or so.

As long as you're growing and consuming, you respond to the signal action of the glutamate. But once your size is established, if you keep eating that same amount, you're going to have a lot of excess beyond your needs—excess histidine, tryptophan, methionine, cysteine, aspartate, glutamate, all of these potentially excitotoxic amino acids.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** When you recommend people consume 75 to 100 grams of protein a day, you're not recommending they consume that all in the form of muscle, meat or eggs. Most of your protein recommendations, you believe should be coming from dairy.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And after you're grown up in size, you should try to learn to go by your actual biological urges rather than what advertising tells you to eat. As your metabolic rate slows down and that happens steadily from puberty, it first slows down very quickly after puberty and then has a steady annual decline of ability to make new tissue and produce energy. So the older you are, the more careful you have to be about having an excess of the especially excitotoxic amino acids.

Gelatin is considered an incomplete protein because animals and people can't grow if they aren't getting the amino acids lacking in gelatin. But many old women have lived for years on a diet of toast and jello and tea, practically their only protein being the gelatin, which is not a complete protein. This illustrates what a very tiny amount a very old person needs.

## MSG in Hidden Sources

tags: [[MSG]] [[food labels]] [[yeast extract]] [[glutamate sources]]

**Andrew Murray:** Let me just quickly outline the typical foods that people will probably be aware or unaware of that are glutamate rich. Hydrolyzed vegetable protein is very high in glutamate, autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed yeast, yeast extracts, soy extracts, and protein isolate—all very high in glutamate. These form a fairly large part of a vegetarian or vegan diet as an alternative protein source, but they do contain a lot of glutamate.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Yeah, a lot of bouillons, I notice, even if they're organic and they say organic vegetable bouillon or organic chicken bouillon or beef bouillon, they have a yeast extract. And I notice if I use that or eat that, I feel like I've had an MSG burn on my tongue.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I wonder if it's allowed to be in products without being listed as an additive.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think legally it has to be listed. They have some alternatives like calling it a vegetable broth or something when it's really an MSG extracted from soybean.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** What about tamari, the wheat-free fermented soy sauce? Doesn't that form like a natural MSG as well?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I think so.

**Andrew Murray:** I saw an article that curcumin from turmeric protects against monosodium glutamate neurotoxicity and decreases NMDA2B. That's another good plus point for turmeric and its anti-inflammatory activity. There are lots of flavonoids like quercetin and myricetin in coffee, which has lots of tissue protective, anti-cancer, anti-dementia effects that are largely the effect of the flavonoid components.

## Protective Compounds Against MSG Neurotoxicity

tags: [[curcumin]] [[turmeric]] [[flavonoids]] [[coffee]] [[neuroprotection]] [[hippocampus]]

**Andrew Murray:** Another article mentioned the vital role of the hippocampus in memory formation and regulation of behavior, showing that glutamate was involved in increasing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which contributes to the brain damage and the death of neurons.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There has been a lot of study of how the excitotoxic things like glutamate actually work. The cells were being protected by high glucose addition without changing the concentration of aspartate or glutamate inside the cell. What was happening was that normally the process of responding to the excitotoxin means that the cell is taking up and retaining the excitatory molecule calcium. When the cell retains too much, it goes into the excited, inflamed, energy-wasting state.

The addition of extra glucose allowed the cell to extrude more calcium as it continued to metabolize. The calcium was being pushed out of the cell under the influence of the glucose. The mechanism involves glucose promoting the increase of carbon dioxide formation as it's metabolized. The carbon dioxide forming the carbonic acid leaves the cell and takes with it the counter ion, the doubly positively charged calcium and some sodium. So the flow of glucose carbonic acid out of the cell is taking care of the calcium accumulation, which is the basic cause of the inflammation, pain and cell death.

## Caller Questions

## Understanding Inflammation and Aging

tags: [[inflammation]] [[inflammaging]] [[carbon monoxide]] [[heme oxygenase]] [[aging]]

**Caller (Avenue of the Giants):** Can you explain the inflammation? What you mean—is it inflammation of the cells or inflammation around the muscle tissue and particularly around like arthritis and just the aches and pains of getting older?

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Pete, would you want to briefly explain inflammation in terms of its physical process?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** People in recent years have been talking about inflammaging as if that explains something. But the process of aging obviously involves increased inflammation. The problem is to see what the basic events are in cell structure. Pain, excitation, inflammation and aging all have these aspects of cytotoxic cell damage and the inability to remedy the problem by making enough energy or delivering enough energy.

Heme oxygenation, one of the emergency enzymes that produces carbon monoxide—there have been probably 95% of the publications describing carbon monoxide as an antioxidant, very protective. But if you look at the deteriorated brain in old age, there is more carbon monoxide in it than at any previous life stage. Carbon monoxide presence is a degenerative aspect of inflammation and cell deterioration.

If you block the formation of carbon monoxide, you prevent most of the damage, development, edema and cell death. So the chemistry of aging, inflammation and deterioration—it's a complex of things that express the same idea as excitotoxicity and wasteful energy waste processes.

## Healing Time and Estrogen Reduction

tags: [[healing time]] [[metabolic rate]] [[polyunsaturated fats]] [[fibroids]] [[thyroid hormone]]

**Caller (South Central Los Angeles):** How long does the body take to heal from all the damage? Let's say you reduce all the estrogen, the polyunsaturated fat, all the inflammatory things. How long does it take for somebody's body to reverse the damage? Is there a difference in age or is it the same for everyone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The young person with the higher metabolic rate can change everything more quickly. The average person, if you move from a country that eats a lot of polyunsaturated fats to a country that eats very little of them, it can take four years to equilibrate to the new balance in the diet.

But if you make an extreme effort, like one of the early researchers in supposed essentiality of polyunsaturated fat—about three or four months into a diet absolutely lacking polyunsaturated fats, all of his chronic health problems disappeared, chronic migraine and other symptoms, and stayed away. So in his case, with an extreme avoidance of just one harmful nutrient, his lifelong problems disappeared in just a few months.

**Caller Follow-up:** Would that also apply if you reduce things to get rid of estrogen? My wife suffers from fibroids and has had a couple of miscarriages because of the fibroid.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** With the right amount—for example, a friend of mine who was 40 and wanted to get pregnant had a tennis ball-sized fibroid blocking the end of her uterus so the tubes couldn't open to deliver the ovum. But she took an overdose of thyroid. Every month the thyroid was shrunken. I think it was about the fifth month it had become about a fourth of its original size and she was pregnant.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the five months made a big difference just by using thyroid hormone. Natural thyroid hormone lowered her estrogen and improved her liver function.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And there are so many other out of balance components of diet—too much iron in most people's food, too much methionine, aspartate, glutamate, cysteine. By fixing any one component, you can see drastic effects. So if you fixed half a dozen of these things that are out of balance, it should produce very huge effects quickly.

## Pediatric Intestinal Bleeding and GI Health

tags: [[pediatric bleeding]] [[Meckel's lesion]] [[carrageenan]] [[chamomile]] [[tannins]] [[GI inflammation]] [[iron]]

**Caller (Arcata):** I have a young grandson who has had two episodes of big intestinal bleeding, a couple of visits to a pediatric hospital with every scope of his upper and lower GI done, not finding anything. My question is could you recommend any foods that would be soothing to the GI tract or nutritionally beneficial?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The first thing to do would be to absolutely avoid foods that had added gums, especially carrageenan. A very high percentage of foods now contain vegetable gums or microbial gums or carrageenan, all of which are very pro-inflammatory. And just knocking out those foods can stop things like chronic bowel bleeding.

**Caller:** Would aloe vera or slippery elm be helpful to be soothing?

**Andrew Murray:** In herbal medicine, particularly in Germany and Europe where I studied, chamomile was the number one GI anti-inflammatory. It's got a fairly pronounced effect in blocking inflammation and soothing the GI tract. Chamomile is mother of the gut, nurse of the gut. That would be one of the first things that I would give somebody from a herbal perspective. Gentle tannins would also be indicated from an herbal perspective to gently astringe the capillaries or the other tissues that are leaking blood into the lumen of the small intestine or large intestine.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that can be as simple as like black tea or green tea.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, black tea would be totally indicated, as would many other astringent containing herbs like potentilla.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And it's very important to check thyroid and vitamin D levels because a deficiency of either of those can make the intestine hyper sensitive to inflammation.

**Andrew Murray:** Hemoglobin would be looked at because if he's had long-term chronic bleeding, he'd be anemic and that's going to be a necessary negative factor for him in terms of his energy. And to support that, plenty of foods that would contain naturally present iron rather than any iron supplement. Iron is very reactive and quite inflammatory. So definitely go with foods that would be iron rich, like liver.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, and avoiding synthetic vitamin C. The synthetic vitamin C reacts with the traces of iron in your body to produce inflammation.
