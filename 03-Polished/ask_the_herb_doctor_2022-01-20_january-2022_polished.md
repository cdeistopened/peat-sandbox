## Introduction

Welcome to the January 21, 2022 edition of Ask the Herb Doctor on KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM, broadcasting from the Redwood coast of California. We're covering this month's subjects: MSG and cancer, continuation of estrogen and its progressively destructive effects, the induction of autoimmunity and cancer, and the link between COVID and MSG through their negative effects on the immune system.

## Dr. Ray Peat's Background

**Andrew Mai:** Let me introduce our guest Dr. Ray Peat, and tell our audience about your expertise.

**Dr. Peat:** I was initially a student of humanities, teaching painting and English literature. I became interested in language and how the brain accomplishes this feat, so I pursued graduate school in biology to study the brain. In 1968, I went to the University of Oregon and found the nerve biology section extremely dogmatic—they cared more about their theories than experimental evidence. However, the aging research and reproductive physiology labs were genuinely interested in understanding what was actually happening. I completed my dissertation in 1972 on age-related oxidative changes in the hamster uterus. This research revealed an enormous amount of information relevant to brain function, aging, and the principles that allow organisms to redesign cells and begin new life from a single fertilized ovum. These same principles apply to understanding brain function in relation to behavior and language. I've been working on these subjects ever since.

## Herbal Perspectives on Estrogen Modulation

**Andrew Mai:** Before we dive into MSG, I want to share several herbal remedies that have been shown to modulate estrogen and its effects.

The first is Momordica charantia, or bitter melon—a cucurbitaceous vine-bearing plant with estrogen-modulating properties. It also functions as an anti-diabetic plant, helping regulate blood glucose.

Second is artemisinin, a component of wormwood (Artemisia annua), which contains antiparasitic, antimicrobial, and antiviral properties. Research has shown it reduces estrogen receptor function in breast cancer cell lines.

Additionally, tamoxifen shows potential utility in treating immune-mediated disorders arising from aberrant helper T cell activity, including allograft rejection and Crohn's disease. The shift away from cellular immunity represents a significant step in fostering a cancerogenic environment, which may limit tamoxifen's anti-cancer effects and explain why it's inferior to other anti-estrogens for preventing disease recurrence in early-stage breast tumors.

## MSG and Excitotoxicity: An Overview

Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is one of the most abundantly found amino acids in nature. The FDA considers it safe to add to food, where it functions as a flavor enhancer and is designated as food additive E621. It appears in foods as hydrolyzed protein or as a purified monosodium salt.

Historically, MSG was promoted as responsible for increasing temperature, decreasing body mass, and reducing fat tissue production. However, this was primarily a sales ploy to promote the flavoring substance.

**Dr. Peat:** In the 1970s, researcher J.W. Olney demonstrated that when rats were fed amounts exceeding normal dietary intake, the brain sustained damage resulting in lifelong obesity. The destroyed appetite-regulating brain tissue left appetite out of control while the metabolic rate proved insufficient to maintain weight. Over several years, Olney conducted numerous experiments showing that similar molecules—aspartic acid, aspartame, and variations—produced excitatory effects through the glutamate or aspartate receptor. One positive-seeming effect was increased alertness, but this came at the expense of insufficient energy production to meet the high energy consumption caused by the excitatory action.

## Aspartame and Brain Cancer

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Isn't aspartame the fake sugar, like Splenda?

**Michael:** Aspartame is aspartic acid with methanol, which degrades into methanol that accumulates in your neurons.

**Dr. Peat:** Aspartame is a supersweet material, sweeter than saccharin, but the toxic amount is very small. Researchers have demonstrated it can cause brain cancer. In the late 1970s, Olney and others showed a sudden rising incidence of gliomas—malignant glial cell tumors, or brain cancer. He demonstrated these could be caused by overfeeding glutamate or MSG to animals. The rise in population incidence and mortality from these tumors followed by a few years the introduction of foods loaded with aspartame and MSG. Animal research shows no growing incidence of brain cancer when these compounds are absent.

Both MSG/aspartame and cell phones cause excitotoxicity. Cell phone radiation excites cells, requiring energy to compensate or the cell dies. When cells are endangered by MSG or aspartame, high-dose glucose interventions can save neurons by providing the energy needed to meet excitation demands.

## The Excitotoxic Mechanism: Cellular Energy Crisis

The fundamental conflict occurs between unavoidable stimulation of excitation and interference with glucose oxidation. This mechanism isn't limited to aging and gliomas—it applies broadly to neurological conditions like epilepsy. When cells cannot generate sufficient energy to match excitation levels, seizures become uncontrollable and damage tissue. Any cell capable of exaggerated stimulation can be rescued through adequate sugar supply, but without it, the cell may become cancerous, form tumors, or die, leading to dementia or various brain function losses depending on affected cell types.

Overlapping influences compound the problem: cell phone radiation, aspartame, MSG, stress, vibration, overstimulation, glucose deprivation, and oxygen deprivation all produce excitatory effects.

Energy feeding through sugar has a sedative action, reducing harmful excitation. Conversely, when cells perceive insufficient energy, they activate emergency responses including serotonin production (leading to hibernation-like states), histamine formation (opening blood vessels to increase blood delivery), estrogen activation, nitric oxide formation (vasodilation), and heme oxygenase activation (breaking down heme for antioxidant benefit, producing bilirubin and carbon monoxide).

## Protein Metabolism and Excitotoxic Amino Acids

**Michael:** How can the body benefit from a high-protein diet when glutamate triggers excitotoxicity and many protein sources are MSG sources?

**Andrew:** Hydrolyzed protein, whey, and soy protein are major MSG sources.

**Dr. Peat:** In nature, protein is a rare delicacy for most animals, creating a strong survival urge to consume it for building muscle and making new tissue. However, when societies provide abundant cheap protein, people abandon appetite-guided eating and consume protein from habit and advertising rather than genuine need.

People tend to overeat protein after age 20 when growth slows. They continue consuming the amounts they ate as 15-year-olds. While growing and actively consuming, the glutamate signaling proves beneficial—triggering anabolic states that utilize amino acids to build muscle, brain tissue, and renew tissues. However, once size stabilization occurs, continued excessive protein consumption creates surplus beyond needs: excess histidine, tryptophan, methionine, cysteine, aspartate, and glutamate—all potentially excitotoxic amino acids.

As metabolic rate steadily declines from puberty onward (declining quickly immediately post-puberty, then declining annually), energy-producing capacity and tissue synthesis ability decrease. The older a person becomes, the more careful they must be about excess excitotoxic amino acids.

**Sarah:** When you recommend 75-100 grams daily protein and typically advise no more than two eggs daily, where should most protein come from?

**Dr. Peat:** After reaching your full size, follow your actual biological urges rather than advertising recommendations. As you age, heed reduced appetite signals. As an example, nutritionist Adele Davis noted that gelatin—an incomplete protein lacking amino acids necessary for growth—was sufficient for elderly women who lived for years on toast, jello, and tea diets. This illustrates how minimal protein an older person actually needs.

## MSG in Hidden Sources

Foods high in glutamate that people may not recognize include hydrolyzed vegetable protein, autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed yeast, yeast extracts, soy extracts, and protein isolates. These form large components of vegetarian and vegan diets as alternative protein sources, but contain substantial glutamate amounts.

Many bouillons, even organic ones labeled "organic vegetable bouillon" or "organic chicken bouillon," contain yeast extract that produces MSG-like burning sensations on the tongue.

**Sarah:** Can MSG be in products without listing it as an additive?

**Dr. Peat:** I believe it must be listed legally. They use alternatives like calling it "vegetable broth" when it's really MSG extracted from soybean.

**Sarah:** What about tamari, the wheat-free fermented soy sauce? Doesn't fermented soy protein form natural MSG?

**Dr. Peat:** Yes.

**Sarah:** Should it be limited in the diet?

**Dr. Peat:** I think so.

## Protective Compounds Against MSG Neurotoxicity

Curcumin from turmeric protects against MSG neurotoxicity by decreasing NMDA2B (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 2B) expression in the rat hippocampus, providing another compelling benefit of turmeric's anti-inflammatory activity.

Flavonoids like quercetin and myricetin found in coffee provide tissue protection, anti-cancer, and anti-dementia effects largely through their flavonoid components.

Glutamate increases pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, contributing to brain damage and neuronal death, revealing the mechanism by which excitotoxicity damages the brain and hippocampus—vital for memory formation and behavior regulation.

The mechanism of glucose protection operates differently than initially assumed. Rather than reducing excitotoxic agent uptake, high glucose addition protects cells without changing intracellular aspartate or glutamate concentration. Instead, glucose enables cells to extrude more calcium during metabolism.

Calcium is the excitatory molecule cells must normally exclude. When cells retain excessive calcium, they enter excited, inflamed, energy-wasting states. Additional glucose allows cells to extrude more calcium through its continued metabolism. The mechanism appears to involve glucose promoting increased carbon dioxide formation during metabolism. Carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid, which leaves the cell carrying the counter-ion of doubly-charged calcium along with sodium. This glucose carbonic acid efflux manages the calcium accumulation—the basic cause of inflammation, pain, and cell death.
