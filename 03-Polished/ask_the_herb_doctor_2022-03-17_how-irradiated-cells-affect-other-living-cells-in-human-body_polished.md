## Introduction

Welcome to the March 18, 2022 edition of Ask the Herb Doctor on KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM. This month's topic continues our discussion of mTOR and introduces the critical concept of the cancer field—how irradiated cells and stressed cells affect other living cells in the human body at a distance. We'll also explore the difference between mechanistic and holistic approaches to understanding disease.

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's edition of Ask your Herb Doctor. It's March 18, 2022. You're listening to Ask your Herb Doctor on KMUD, Garberville 91.1 FM from 7:30 till the end of the show at 8:00 o'clock. Callers are invited to call in with questions related to this month's continuing topic of mTOR and a further discussion of holistic versus mechanistic approaches to the treatment of disease. So without further ado, let's introduce Dr. Raymond Peat, who once again is joining us. Dr. Pete, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hi.

**Andrew Murray:** Well, thank you as always for giving your time. I'm constantly reminded of people who have never heard of alternatives. I cannot take it for granted, and I'm sure you don't take it for granted either, that some people just don't know that there are alternatives to the standard model—whether it's treatment, chemicals, or whatever it is. For those people who are listening both now and who will pick this up on the audio archives at some point in the future, would you just give an outline of your academic and professional background so people that are listening can hear about you?

## Dr. Raymond Peat's Background

tags: [[credentials]] [[biography]] [[reproductive physiology]] [[oxidative metabolism]] [[aging research]]

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Before I studied biology in graduate school, I was studying linguistics, literature, psychology, and teaching in those areas. I decided I needed more technical science background to understand how the brain works in relation to humanities and language. So in 1968 I went to graduate school at University of Oregon in biology and did my dissertation, finished in 1972, in the area of reproductive physiological aging—the changes of oxidative metabolism during aging and its effect on reproduction. I've been applying insights and related things to all sorts of problems in the 50 years since then.

**Andrew Murray:** All right, well, thank you for that. So for those of you who are listening now, we take callers from 7:30 to the end of the show, 8:00 o'clock. The number is 707-923-3911. Dr. Pete, I think what I'd like to do—and you're exquisitely aware of this, no doubt. But just for those who are listening tonight and who will listen to the archives—I wanted to carry on last month's topic of the findings around research, of which there's lots of papers written in 2022, 2021, and 2020, based on the concept of mTOR, the mechanistic target of rapamycin, and its use in cancer. The bulk of the evening show is going to remain based on alternative approaches to cancer.

What we do here is give the scientific background for the relevance of certain substances, whether natural or synthetic, used as a better approach to treatment of disease. I wanted to ask you, Dr. Pete, just give an outline of how the alternatives have been usurped in many ways by the modern approach to disease and how the machinery which drives that research is corrupted by the interests of financial and vested interests. We really haven't made hardly any significant increases in our knowledge of the treatment of cancer in particular. So with tonight's discussion a continuation of last month's and previous other shows based on alternatives, would you just give an outline of the kind of prior history of those thinkers like Szent-Gyorgyi and numerous others you've discussed in describing other processes that we've used for radio show topics in the past? How the thinking of these classical people that are steeped in biology and not in mechanistic approaches has changed, and what we are currently faced with in medicine, which doesn't seek to treat people holistically?

## Mechanistic vs. Holistic Approaches to Biology

tags: [[Warburg]] [[Szent-Gyorgyi]] [[reductionism]] [[holistic biology]] [[oxidative metabolism]] [[mitochondria]]

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the mechanistic materialist view—reducing everything to a cause and effect relation between two simple bits of matter—makes everything seem absolutely clear to the people who have defined science that way. But when you focus on the interaction of two or just a few particles, you can understand those very clearly. But when you're focused that way, you miss the whole context.

People like Warburg and Szent-Gyorgyi looked at the whole picture of biology. Warburg saw things that happened in yeast and saw them happening in cancer—production of lactate, lactic acid, even in the presence of oxygen. He had the insight that this is something very important about the nature of life.

Szent-Gyorgyi was following up on insights by other people such as W.F. Koch and worked out the classical presentation view of how oxidation and mitochondrial metabolism work. But he kept in mind the whole organism and what's going on at every level—water and energy supply interactions and everything that feeds into the life process. He didn't focus on a few reductionistic material interactions that ordinary science does.

As a result, Warburg's work was ridiculed and ignored for about 50 years or more. It was only around the beginning of this century that things he did in the 1920s started to be appreciated, but generally misunderstood. Szent-Gyorgyi's work on cancer involved things that biologists and doctors had never heard of or even thought of. The idea of what electrons in water are doing and how motion is the essential feature of life—it's powered by the organized flow of electrons. He applied that to cancer as well as muscle function and circulation.

Every aspect of biology can be re-understood in terms of very simple things that act everywhere. There's no single place in metabolism where electrons and water and muscles react to produce motion—it's a fundamental quality of life. The really scientific work attempting to understand the organism in terms of everything that can be known about it scientifically—the mainline science people are blind to that because it doesn't fit into reductionistic or mechanistic materialism.

## Radiation and the Whole Organism

tags: [[radiation]] [[whole organism]] [[stress response]] [[estrogen]] [[hormonal changes]] [[X-rays]]

**Andrew Murray:** I think the concept of looking for a cause and effect—driving that mechanistic approach—is largely ignored. The concept, if you like, of a living organism interacting with its environment and being affected directly by its environment. In looking at your quarterly newsletter, you mentioned the presence and the absolute knowledge of the cancer field—not as a theory but as a reality. For people that are listening, just to understand that not only the concept of the bystander effect exists, whereby if a cell is irradiated outside of the body and is introduced into the body, it can have a similarly damaging effect—not because it's typically releasing high energy electrons, but because the stress signals that the cell will give out as a result of being irradiated have a direct effect on other cells it comes into direct contact with or at a distance. That's a reality. It's almost like a quantum physical event that probably only with the last 10 or 15 years of science opening up quantum theory are we able to put it into that place where we can begin to imagine such a thing is actually happening.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If people were demonstrating the phenomenon 60 years ago, they knew that if you x-ray an animal, you didn't have to x-ray the brain and pituitary because generalized hormonal changes would occur. For example, it would cause the animal to go into heat. Females, if you irradiated their foot, the same thing would happen. The whole organism would shift hormonal balance towards reproductive heat. That is an example of the whole body as a cancer field.

The signal from the radiation is a holistic stress on the whole organism that spreads something that promotes cancer. The mainstream biologists and medical people are still insisting that radiation causes spot damage to the DNA—causes a mutation in one gene of the DNA—and that this mechanistic one-to-one damage somehow works its way out, ending up as cancer. But that simply isn't a realistic picture.

The radiation doesn't have to hit the DNA. It does something excitatory and pro-inflammatory to the organism, separate from anything it might do to the DNA. That general stress reaction to radiation turns on signals that transmit estrogen-like signals all through the body. People have found out that you can treat radiation poisoning and estrogen poisoning in the same way. And if you add radiation to estrogen, you've had an additive effect of the damage.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So Dr. Pete, this is why you strongly recommend against any form of radiation, but specifically dental X-rays. Because X-rays damage fast-dividing cells. When you have a dental X-ray, it's affecting your brain, which is very rapidly dividing, your eyes, your thyroid, and tongue.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cancer of the tonsil, eye cancer, and brain cancer have all increased along with the incidence or intensity of dental X-rays. A study in Seattle several years ago put a lead shield over the abdomen of pregnant women and found that a full set of dental X-rays—with thyroid and the pelvis and everything shielded by lead—caused the babies to be born underweight and underdeveloped if the mother was pregnant at the time. They developed the same way any stress or excess estrogen would do.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the stress of that dental X-ray spread all the way down to the uterus and the developing baby.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything in the body.

## The Cancer Field and Bystander Effect

tags: [[cancer field]] [[bystander effect]] [[lactic acid]] [[cellular stress]] [[gradient damage]]

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to just briefly get into the term cancer field before we open up the lines. I wanted to outline this concept of the cancer field and how it propagates damage. You wrote in your January newsletter that the cancer field is set up such that the actual tumor itself, in a radiating pattern out from the tumor, has differing degrees of damage to the cells. Essentially, there's a radiating pattern of damage from the central tumor out to distant tissues beyond the tumor that are pre-cancerous, and that is propagated by a direct pathway similar to the bystander effect.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, any of the intense stresses like oxygen or glucose deficiency will reduce efficient oxygen metabolism and cause stress signals. When one particular area is responding more intensely to stress, what you get is a small local version, maybe a few inches in diameter, of the organismic bystander effect. The bystander effect refers to things that are well-distributed through the body.

But the intense signals, such as a cell that is approaching or already turned into cancer, will chronically produce an excess of lactic acid, even when it gets oxygen. So there will be a gradient of lactic acid surrounding that cell that irritates and disturbs the nearby cells, which then begin producing lactic acid, and that spreads maybe through a few centimeters of solid tissue. Just the local diffusion causes a visible gradient, ending up in a gradient of DNA damage and mutations.

It's hard to list all of the factors other than lactic acid that are diffusing out of an injured cell. They include carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, inflammatory cytokines—a variety of those. Everything that the body uses to respond protectively to damage. It can help local tissues multiply faster so that they can fill in a wound, for example, accelerates the movement and replication of cells. That's an essential part of healing a wound, but when it's coming from a mutated or seriously damaged group of cells, then it's tending to simply spread the damage rather than accelerate the healing.

So all of these are normal healing factors—like activating the local production of estrogen. That's a normal part of repairing tissue damage. But when it is prolonged and something causes the body to be unable to turn it off, each of these things adds to the spreading effect. As far as it diffuses locally, you'll see this gradient of deterioration, including mutations. And meanwhile, it's adding a burden to the whole organism with the more likely radiation bystander effect.

## The mTOR/PI3K/AKT Pathway in Cancer

tags: [[mTOR]] [[PI3K]] [[AKT]] [[cancer pathway]] [[signaling mechanism]] [[pathway activation]]

**Andrew Murray:** Before I guess we get into the continued dialogue about mTOR and its importance as a target for the treatment of cancer, I just wanted to outline this differentiation between mechanistic versus holistic approach to treatment. I read an article in preparing for this which was exhaustive and had a lot of good reference material. Basically, they discussed the phosphoinositide 3 kinase and AKT and mTOR pathway as a three-branched signaling pathway.

They said that essentially approximately 70% of ovarian and breast cancers are activated by a derangement in this pathway. And about 90% of lung adenocarcinomas show an aberrant activation of this pathway. Then 40% or so of squamous cell carcinomas are activated by this pathway. Last month we talked about mTOR for the first time, and you mentioned mTOR 1 and mTOR 2 as being subsets of mTOR. So would you just outline briefly again the mTOR 1 and mTOR 2?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The 1 form is an activating phosphorylating enzyme. When you're normally fed and growing, it's what mediates between eating more and growing more. And if you overeat at any time, you tend to overproduce this growth factor that necessarily leads to the degenerative diseases. Excess calorie intake is very important, and the activation of the cell will turn on mTOR and synthesis and growth such that intracellular calcium increases. Calcium should mostly be outside the cells, but inside the cell, it's an activating factor that increases mTOR.

The 2 form of the enzyme does similar things, but it's fairly insensitive to the usual signals such as overeating. It depends mostly on growth hormone. And many kinds of stress will turn on an excess of growth hormone. Women have spectacularly high levels of growth hormone compared to men as a result of estrogen's stress-inducing effect. So growth hormone has some particular ways of affecting our handling of fat. But that's basically the way mTOR 2 is turned on through high growth hormone.

**Andrew Murray:** And these growth hormones in their own right are proliferative agents that would promote cancer growth.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Andrew Murray:** When I read about the mTOR PI3K and AKT pathways, it looked like it wasn't just about mTOR that we discussed last month, but that these other two arms of the same signaling messenger system—the phosphoinositide and the AKT pathway—were also very good targets for shutting down essentially the energy pathway. I had trouble reconciling this with given that thyroid hormone and progesterone are anti-inflammatory and energy-conserving mechanisms. I was concerned that interfering with energy production might not end well. Perhaps this is the same mechanism by which calorie control and calorie restriction produce greater longevity?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Overeating and mTOR and so on tend to favor the oxidation of fats over glucose. When that happens, you're basically slowing down the constructive part of energy metabolism and shifting over towards some of these risky simple growth pathways.

## Natural mTOR Inhibitors and Protective Compounds

tags: [[turmeric]] [[resveratrol]] [[EGCG]] [[flavonoids]] [[ginger]] [[metformin]] [[PI3K inhibitors]] [[AKT inhibitors]]

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to run through some natural mTOR inhibitors. I think I mentioned turmeric—it's getting a lot of press for its anti-rheumatic, anti-inflammatory effects and for its own anti-cancer effects, and probably gets its anti-cancer benefits from being a natural mTOR inhibitor. And then resveratrol, from Polygonum cuspidatum and from grape skins. And then a compound whose abbreviation is EGCG—epigallocatechin gallate—from green tea, as well as caffeine. I was pleased to see caffeine listed as potentially inhibiting mTOR signaling directly and indirectly.

I saw two other substances that caught my attention. One was a substance called shogaol from ginger root. There was an article reference saying it inhibited the PI3K AKT mTOR pathway by directly targeting AKT 1 and AKT 2 but not the PI3K or the mTOR pathway directly. So ginger was used there specifically for colon cancer.

And then I know you're not into pre-diabetes treating drugs, but metformin. Do you have any good things to say about metformin? Metformin was actually listed as one of those things to inhibit mTOR.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. The only drawback is that it acts to inhibit part of the electron transport chain, so it's impairing the mitochondria while also doing the beneficial thing of turning off mTOR. So it's good to be cautious about metformin because there's not enough known about it. But still its effects are generally protective through inhibiting mTOR.

**Andrew Murray:** Do you think there's much value in using some of these substances as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's? I saw other references for neurodegenerative disorders and then I think there may have been a Parkinson's indication because of the amyloid beta that could be treated or decreased and the neurofibrillary tangles that could be mitigated by using some of these substances because of their effect on mTOR and mTOR's downstream effects on amyloid production.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, inflammation is involved in all of the degenerative processes. And so the anti-inflammatory, anti-mTOR things are turning out to be protective against obesity, Alzheimer's, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus—anything you can think of turns out to involve inflammation at its root.

## Caller Questions: Turmeric Extraction and Medicinal Use

tags: [[turmeric]] [[herbal extraction]] [[culinary medicine]] [[heavy metals]] [[bioavailability]]

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, let me give out the number. We do have a caller. If people would like to call in, it's 707-923-3911. Dr. Raymond Peat with us. So caller, you're on the air. Where are you from? What's your question?

**Caller Margaret (Garberville):** Hello, Andrew and Sarah, this is Margaret and Dr. Pete. I'm grateful for your show. So I'm from Garberville and your mention of turmeric caught me because I use turmeric daily pretty much. But I know that there's a tendency in our society to find something like turmeric or other extractives from other herbs and things, and it's like, oh, this is so great. I'm going to put it in capsules and take, you know, like 5 milligrams of it every day. And I was wondering if you would address whether that's really beneficial or if it's beneficial enough to take it in your ordinary diet, you know, just as it comes kind of. Do we have to really sock it to our bodies with all of these extracts and pills and things? You know, is that clear the question?

**Andrew Murray:** I think some of this comes from studying populations in countries that use it in their cuisine. So whether the Indian subcontinent or the Asian subcontinent, where they use a lot of turmeric and ginger and these other substances—I think they have fairly low incidences of colorectal cancer, and I think they've kind of put the two and two together. When they've looked at turmeric and its anti-inflammatory activity, they've posited that as a potential mechanism by which they have fairly low incidences.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think you can overeat on the so-called protective things. Same with vitamin C. Instead of being antioxidant, it becomes pro-oxidant when it begins producing excess electrons themselves.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** More in a culinary fashion. Yeah, so we're eating our medicine instead of taking capsules. And remember too is a lot of traditional cultures make teas out of these things. They're not just swallowing tablespoons of turmeric root. They're putting some in their cooking, and if they're going to make it into a medicine, they make it into a tea, which helps extract the medicinal constituents like a tincture does, without having to have all the extra fiber and potential extra heavy metals that are in herbs that don't get extracted in the tea and the tincture like they would in the root of turmeric.

**Andrew Murray:** That's a very good point because having looked at these botanicals and put them through ICP-MS to see what levels of California's heavy metals—arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury—are within these herbs as part of a GMP process to produce these extracts and sell them, I know from data that the raw plant root contains very high levels in some cases of those compounds, and the extracts contain virtually none. And so the extract process is very clean compared to the root of the actual herb if you were going to consume it in powder or capsule form.

We've done shows on this with fish in the ocean and shown how much arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury is in them. The same goes for any plant material that you would ingest in powder or capsule form. We're not at all in agreement with capsules and powders over extracts, because extracts do not bring out the heavy metal content of the raw material.

## Caller Questions: Sugar Types and Cancer Metabolism

tags: [[glucose]] [[sugar types]] [[honey]] [[fructose]] [[cancer metabolism]] [[cortisol]]

**Caller Margie (Pepperwood):** Hi, my name is Margie and I would like a clarification. When Dr. Peat says sugar, does that mean just fructose or honey? Natural sugars. And I can take my answer off the air.

**Andrew Murray:** You kind of read my mind there. I was going to ask the same question, because I think Dr. Pete would say to get it from honey and to get it from sugar. But yeah, Dr. Pete, it's also good to get it from carbohydrates or do you want to get it from sugar or honey? Because I think carbohydrates are also important.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coming from starch or other more complex healthy starches, carbohydrates. But the problem is some of those, like sweet potatoes, are such mixtures. They have woody material and fats and indigestible things mixed in with the otherwise useful carbohydrates. So you can't just say that any starch is going to be equivalent to glucose or sucrose or honey. It depends on whether it's digestible.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Well, I think I want to go back to the sugar issue and the cancer issue that you touched on earlier. Every cell in the body needs glucose to operate. So if you don't eat any kind of sugar, your body's going to turn on a harmful metabolism to make sugar. And that is involving lactic acid. Correct, Dr. Pete?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And high cortisol. Cortisol is necessary to mobilize and break down the protein to make amino acids and glucose, which also promotes cancer.
