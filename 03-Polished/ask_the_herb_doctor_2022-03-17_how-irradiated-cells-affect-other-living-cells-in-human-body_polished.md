## Introduction

Welcome to the March 18, 2022 edition of Ask the Herb Doctor on KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM. This month's topic continues our discussion of mTOR and introduces the critical concept of the cancer field—how irradiated cells and stressed cells affect other living cells in the human body at a distance. We'll also explore the difference between mechanistic and holistic approaches to understanding disease.

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's edition of Ask your Herb Doctor. It's March 18, 2022. You're listening to Ask your Herb Doctor on KMUD, Garberville 91.1 FM from 7:30 till the end of the show at 8:00 o'clock. Callers are invited to call in with questions related to this month's continuing topic of mTOR and a further discussion of holistic versus mechanistic approaches to the treatment of disease. So without further ado, let's introduce Dr. Raymond Peat, who once again is joining us. Dr. Pete, are you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, hi.

**Andrew Murray:** Well, thank you as always for giving your time. I'm constantly reminded of people who have never heard of alternatives. I cannot take it for granted, and I'm sure you don't take it for granted either, that some people just don't know that there are alternatives to the standard model—whether it's treatment, chemicals, or whatever it is. For those people who are listening both now and who will pick this up on the audio archives at some point in the future, would you just give an outline of your academic and professional background so people that are listening can hear about you?

## Dr. Raymond Peat's Background

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Before I studied biology in graduate school, I was studying linguistics, literature, psychology, and teaching in those areas. I decided I needed more technical science background to understand how the brain works in relation to humanities and language. So in 1968 I went to graduate school at University of Oregon in biology and did my dissertation, finished in 1972, in the area of reproductive physiological aging—the changes of oxidative metabolism during aging and its effect on reproduction. I've been applying insights and related things to all sorts of problems in the 50 years since then.

**Andrew Murray:** All right, well, thank you for that. So for those of you who are listening now, we take callers from 7:30 to the end of the show, 8:00 o'clock. The number is 707-923-3911. Dr. Pete, I think what I'd like to do—and you're exquisitely aware of this, no doubt. But just for those who are listening tonight and who will listen to the archives—I wanted to carry on last month's topic of the findings around research, of which there's lots of papers written in 2022, 2021, and 2020, based on the concept of mTOR, the mechanistic target of rapamycin, and its use in cancer. The bulk of the evening show is going to remain based on alternative approaches to cancer.

What we do here is give the scientific background for the relevance of certain substances, whether natural or synthetic, used as a better approach to treatment of disease. I wanted to ask you, Dr. Pete, just give an outline of how the alternatives have been usurped in many ways by the modern approach to disease and how the machinery which drives that research is corrupted by the interests of financial and vested interests. We really haven't made hardly any significant increases in our knowledge of the treatment of cancer in particular. So with tonight's discussion a continuation of last month's and previous other shows based on alternatives, would you just give an outline of the kind of prior history of those thinkers like Szent-Gyorgyi and numerous others you've discussed in describing other processes that we've used for radio show topics in the past? How the thinking of these classical people that are steeped in biology and not in mechanistic approaches has changed, and what we are currently faced with in medicine, which doesn't seek to treat people holistically?

## Mechanistic vs. Holistic Approaches to Biology

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the mechanistic materialist view—reducing everything to a cause and effect relation between two simple bits of matter—makes everything seem absolutely clear to the people who have defined science that way. But when you focus on the interaction of two or just a few particles, you can understand those very clearly. But when you're focused that way, you miss the whole context.

People like Warburg and Szent-Gyorgyi looked at the whole picture of biology. Warburg saw things that happened in yeast and saw them happening in cancer—production of lactate, lactic acid, even in the presence of oxygen. He had the insight that this is something very important about the nature of life.

Szent-Gyorgyi was following up on insights by other people such as W.F. Koch and worked out the classical presentation view of how oxidation and mitochondrial metabolism work. But he kept in mind the whole organism and what's going on at every level—water and energy supply interactions and everything that feeds into the life process. He didn't focus on a few reductionistic material interactions that ordinary science does.

As a result, Warburg's work was ridiculed and ignored for about 50 years or more. It was only around the beginning of this century that things he did in the 1920s started to be appreciated, but generally misunderstood. Szent-Gyorgyi's work on cancer involved things that biologists and doctors had never heard of or even thought of. The idea of what electrons in water are doing and how motion is the essential feature of life—it's powered by the organized flow of electrons. He applied that to cancer as well as muscle function and circulation.

Every aspect of biology can be re-understood in terms of very simple things that act everywhere. There's no single place in metabolism where electrons and water and muscles react to produce motion—it's a fundamental quality of life. The really scientific work attempting to understand the organism in terms of everything that can be known about it scientifically—the mainline science people are blind to that because it doesn't fit into reductionistic or mechanistic materialism.

## Radiation and the Whole Organism

**Andrew Murray:** I think the concept of looking for a cause and effect—driving that mechanistic approach—is largely ignored. The concept, if you like, of a living organism interacting with its environment and being affected directly by its environment. In looking at your quarterly newsletter, you mentioned the presence and the absolute knowledge of the cancer field—not as a theory but as a reality. For people that are listening, just to understand that not only the concept of the bystander effect exists, whereby if a cell is irradiated outside of the body and is introduced into the body, it can have a similarly damaging effect—not because it's typically releasing high energy electrons, but because the stress signals that the cell will give out as a result of being irradiated have a direct effect on other cells it comes into direct contact with or at a distance. That's a reality. It's almost like a quantum physical event that probably only with the last 10 or 15 years of science opening up quantum theory are we able to put it into that place where we can begin to imagine such a thing is actually happening.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** If people were demonstrating the phenomenon 60 years ago, they knew that if you x-ray an animal, you didn't have to x-ray the brain and pituitary because generalized hormonal changes would occur. For example, it would cause the animal to go into heat. Females, if you irradiated their foot, the same thing would happen. The whole organism would shift hormonal balance towards reproductive heat. That is an example of the whole body as a cancer field.

The signal from the radiation is a holistic stress on the whole organism that spreads something that promotes cancer. The mainstream biologists and medical people are still insisting that radiation causes spot damage to the DNA—causes a mutation in one gene of the DNA—and that this mechanistic one-to-one damage somehow works its way out, ending up as cancer. But that simply isn't a realistic picture.

The radiation doesn't have to hit the DNA. It does something excitatory and pro-inflammatory to the organism, separate from anything it might do to the DNA. That general stress reaction to radiation turns on signals that transmit estrogen-like signals all through the body. People have found out that you can treat radiation poisoning and estrogen poisoning in the same way. And if you add radiation to estrogen, you've had an additive effect of the damage.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So Dr. Pete, this is why you strongly recommend against any form of radiation, but specifically dental X-rays. Because X-rays damage fast-dividing cells. When you have a dental X-ray, it's affecting your brain, which is very rapidly dividing, your eyes, your thyroid, and tongue.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Cancer of the tonsil, eye cancer, and brain cancer have all increased along with the incidence or intensity of dental X-rays. A study in Seattle several years ago put a lead shield over the abdomen of pregnant women and found that a full set of dental X-rays—with thyroid and the pelvis and everything shielded by lead—caused the babies to be born underweight and underdeveloped if the mother was pregnant at the time. They developed the same way any stress or excess estrogen would do.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So the stress of that dental X-ray spread all the way down to the uterus and the developing baby.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everything in the body.
