## Introduction and Background

Welcome to the February 18, 2022 edition of Ask the Herb Doctor on KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM. This month's topic is mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and its mechanistic role in cancer, aging, and inflammation. We'll explore how this recently discovered pathway represents a novel target for cancer suppression and how dietary and herbal approaches can modulate it.

Andrew and Sarah are licensed practitioners of herbal medicine, qualified in England in 1999-2000. Dr. Ray Peat has been generously sharing his expertise with us monthly for the past 11 years.

## Estrogen as a Cancer Initiator: Fundamental Mechanisms

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, I want to address estrogen's role as a primary cancer-causing agent in the scientific literature. You've long advocated for progesterone as estrogen's antithesis. Women experiencing 14 days of progesterone monthly from menstruation until menopause have better protection against hormone-dependent cancers, especially when they've had successful pregnancies.

**Dr. Ray Peat:** Having children early in life provides enormous cancer protection. Animal studies demonstrate that rabbits bred frequently from early age maintain much younger tissues throughout life compared to lifelong virgins. This is corroborated by Hungarian demographic data showing increased longevity directly correlated with number of children up to eight per woman.

**Andrew Murray:** Important clarification—estrogen isn't exclusively female. Males increasingly produce estrogen with aging, particularly when testosterone converts to estrogen. Gynecomastia and belly fat in aging men are outward signs of estrogen dominance. This enzyme conversion matters significantly.

**Dr. Peat:** By ages 65-70, older men typically produce more estrogen than women—not just in ratio, but in absolute levels. Their testosterone undergoes massive conversion to estrogen.

**Andrew Murray:** The enzyme aromatase expresses in multiple tissues—liver, placenta, bones, and breast tissue. Blocking aromatase becomes crucial for reducing estrogen dominance beyond physiological baseline.

**Dr. Peat:** Early 1940s experiments showed that tiny uninterrupted estrogen doses in ovariectomized animals produced cancer in every tissue. However, even very large estrogen amounts didn't cause cancer if interrupted periodically. The quantity and regularity of progesterone interruption provides almost complete cancer protection. This explains why multiple pregnancies confer statistical protection against estrogen-related cancers—all their tissues become stronger.

## Discovery and Mechanism of mTOR

mTOR was initially discovered as a fungal-killing antibiotic—a broad-spectrum agent in the same family as azithromycin and erythromycin (ring-structure antibiotics known for remarkable activity spectrum). When reports emerged of COVID treatment with hydroxychloroquine combined with azithromycin, the medical establishment ridiculed the claim, falsely insisting antibiotics only kill bacteria. However, this antibiotic class kills viruses and fungi—knowledge actively suppressed in favor of pharmaceutically-profitable antiviral drugs that are generally mutagens.

Beyond fungal activity, rapamycin demonstrates profound anti-inflammatory effects characteristic of this antibiotic family. Investigating its anti-inflammatory mechanism revealed rapamycin acts on a specific kinase—an enzyme phosphorylating other enzymes and proteins to direct activity toward growth and inflammation. Remarkably, inhibiting this phosphorylating enzyme:

- Extends lifespan drastically
- Reduces cancer
- Reduces inflammatory diseases
- Prevents the energy wastage common to inflammatory diseases, aging, diabetes, and cancer

Rapamycin (also called sirolimus) controls energy flow and nutrient abundance. Fats and proteins normally activate mTOR complex 1, while growth hormone primarily activates mTOR complex 2 (which remains insensitive to antibiotics).

## Dietary Activators and Inhibitors of mTOR

**Understanding Key Activators:**

Methionine is probably the main mTOR-activating amino acid among essential amino acids. Meat contains not only high methionine but also iron and phosphate—all mTOR complex 1 activators.

Milk presents an interesting case: though containing high methionine, it also contains calcium and low phosphate/iron. Milk's high calcium content working with vitamin D primarily lowers parathyroid hormone (an mTOR activator), providing milk's own antidote against methionine's toxic effects.

**Coffee and Fruit as Anti-mTOR Agents:**

Coffee provides flavonoids and caffeine—both are anti-mTOR agents. Orange juice and other fruits represent very effective flavonoid sources for reducing mTOR activity.

**Comprehensive Flavonoid Sources for mTOR Inhibition:**

The term "flavonoids" encompasses pigmented compounds coloring fruits and vegetables. These compounds are supreme cancer-fighters, anti-inflammatory agents, and direct mTOR blockers:

- **EGCG and catechins:** Green tea's epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and caffeine—available in powders or fresh green tea
- **Curcumin:** From turmeric; excellent blocker of both mTOR and inflammatory pathways
- **Berberine:** Found in goldenseal, Oregon grape root, and quercetin
- **Quercetin:** Major onion source; explains onion syrup's effectiveness for colds, coughs, and mucus production. Slicing onions into layers and alternating with sugar creates an osmotic gradient extracting quercetin-rich liquid—an antibacterial syrup
- **Additional quercetin sources:** Nettles, pomegranate, orange juice
- **Resveratrol:** Japanese knotweed, grape skins, Japanese pagoda tree (Sophora japonica) flowers and fruits
- **Pterostilbene:** A stilbenoid related to resveratrol, found in almonds, blueberries, huckleberries, cranberries, red grapes, and cocoa—reported to inhibit mTOR in isolated cell culture
- **Fisetin:** A flavonoid in apples, strawberries, and persimmons, successfully used in melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer treatment through sirtuin regulation

The "5 servings of fruits and vegetables" recommendation rests on sound science—the flavonoid content's cancer-fighting and anti-mTOR properties.

## Calorie Restriction vs. Glucose Metabolism

The metabolic rate decreases dramatically after age 20, continuing to decline with age, especially after the mid-40s. However, calorie restriction itself isn't necessary—the key is preventing the metabolic shift toward fat oxidation.

Polyunsaturated fat accumulation drives metabolic preference for fat oxidation over glucose oxidation. When oxidizing glucose at high rates, the resulting carbon dioxide becomes our basic anti-inflammatory substance.

The goal is preventing the shift away from glucose oxidation toward fatty acid oxidation. Degenerative diseases exemplify the problem: diabetes fundamentally involves inability to oxidize glucose, forcing fatty acid oxidation instead. This breaks glucose into lactic acid rather than carbon dioxide, with coordinated metabolic changes.

Critically, **lactic acid activates mTOR**. The popular trend toward fat oxidation through ketogenic diets—promoted as aging and obesity prevention—paradoxically accelerates degeneration. Fat people tend to oxidize higher fatty acid proportions than glucose.

**Cancer operates identically:** Inability to oxidize glucose leads to fatty acid oxidation, inflammation, and mTOR activation through lactic acid instead of inhibition through carbon dioxide. Stress causes preferential fatty acid oxidation over glucose—promoting growth hormone secretion and activating mTOR complex 1 (responsive to rapamycin inhibitors). Complex 2, insensitive to rapamycin, is primarily controlled by growth hormone.

Avoiding stress-induced preferential fatty acid oxidation when oxidizing glucose alternatives supports growth hormone secretion while keeping mTOR inhibited.

## Protein Sources and mTOR Management

**Alternative Proteins to Meat:**

Calcium makes the critical difference between milk and other proteins. Bone broth (with fat skimmed off) and naturally extracted gelatin from chicken skin represent excellent low-mTOR protein sources—they contain very low methionine levels but are rich in glycine, an amino acid with multiple health benefits.

**Glutathione Supplementation Caution:**

Supplemental glutathione is risky despite its cellular importance as the major anti-free radical detoxifying agent. Reduced intracellular materials traveling through the bloodstream face oxidation by stray iron or copper atoms, producing toxic compounds before reaching cells. Increasing cellular reductive balance creates the worst kind of stress—the aging degenerative condition. Supplemental glutathione is almost certainly harmful rather than helpful.

Similarly, excess dietary glutathione activates mTOR and should be limited.

## Hormonal Pathways and Estrogen Detoxification

**Progesterone's Multi-Pathway Anti-Estrogenic Effects:**

Progesterone operates through several simultaneous pathways to counter carcinogenic estradiol:

1. **Aromatase inhibition:** Progesterone blocks the enzyme converting testosterone to estrogen
2. **Estrogen receptor breakdown:** Progesterone degrades estrogen receptors
3. **Detoxification pathway activation:** Progesterone activates enzymes adding glucuronic acid or sulfuric acid to estrogens for excretion
4. **Estradiol conversion:** Progesterone prevents aromatase-mediated estradiol replacement while favoring conversion of estradiol to inactive estrone

**Anti-inflammatory Compounds as mTOR Inhibitors:**

Most recommended anti-inflammatory substances block mTOR because they interrupt the cell cycle promoting inflammation and inflammatory estrogen production.

**Important medication note:** Acetaminophen (Tylenol) activates mTOR and increases inflammatory, degenerative processes. Aspirin, by contrast, is a major mTOR inhibitor and aromatase inhibitor—its benefits are incalculable at a basic metabolic level. Aspirin decreases stroke risk; ibuprofen and acetaminophen increase it. Aspirin was demonized so pharmaceutical companies could promote more profitable Tylenol.
