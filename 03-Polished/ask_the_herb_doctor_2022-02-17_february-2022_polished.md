## Introduction and Background

tags: [[mTOR]] [[cancer]] [[estrogen]] [[rapamycin]] [[aging]] [[inflammation]]

Welcome to the February 18, 2022 edition of Ask the Herb Doctor on KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM. This month's topic is mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) and its mechanistic role in cancer, aging, and inflammation. We'll explore how this recently discovered pathway represents a novel target for cancer suppression and how dietary and herbal approaches can modulate it.

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's February 18, 2022 edition of Ask your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the shows before, we run them every third Friday of the month from 7 PM to 8 PM with the chance to call in live to ask questions from 7:30 until 8 o'clock. The number is 707-923-3911. Our website is westernbotanicalmedicine.com. We are both licensed practitioners of herbal medicine, qualified in England in 1999 and 2000, and have been practicing herbal medicine ever since. We've been very pleased to discover Dr. Raymond Peat and have him share his time pretty much every third Friday of the month for about 11 years now. The subject of this evening is going to be on the science and the principles behind what has now been shown to be a mechanistic determinant of cancer and is described as mTOR, mTOR 1 and mTOR 2. Dr. Pete will outline the biology of it very scientifically and very factually.

## Estrogen as a Cancer Initiator

tags: [[estrogen]] [[progesterone]] [[aromatase]] [[cancer prevention]] [[testosterone]]

**Andrew Murray:** Before we get into the topic of mTOR, I think we should address estrogen's role as the prime causative factor behind many different cancers in the scientific literature. I know you've been a big advocate for progesterone as the antithesis of estrogen. The female, enjoying 14 days of progesterone exposure per month from beginning of menstrual cycle until menopause, has a very good chance, especially if they are having fairly successful and repeat pregnancies, of having a decreased chance of getting hormone-dependent estrogen cancers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Having a child fairly early in life is a huge protection against getting cancer. Animal studies show that if a rabbit, for example, is bred starting early and as often as it can for the rest of its life, its tissues at any old age are much younger than if it had been a virgin all those years. This was backed up by looking at the relation between the number of children up to eight per woman in Hungarian women, and there was a straight increase in longevity with the number of babies up to eight.

**Andrew Murray:** The other thing I just want to remind people that are listening—I don't want to be too obvious, but most people's misconception surrounding estrogen is that it's a female hormone, which is completely untrue. Males are also subject to the effects of estrogen, especially with aging. And in England, obviously from the kind of pub culture of drinking beer being firmly entrenched socially, as males get older you have this gynecomastia, which is a term given to male breast enlargement or male breast tissue enlargement, as well as the kind of belly fat which most people would look at as a sign of poor health. But this is very much an outward expression in a male of estrogen dominance.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And old men typically have more estrogen than women, not just the ratio, but their testosterone is being massively converted to estrogen by the time they're 65 or 70.

**Andrew Murray:** So the fact that this enzyme aromatase, which converts testosterone to estrogen, is expressed in many different cells in the body—not just in the liver, the placenta, in female bones and in breast tissue—this itself can convert testosterone to estrone. Blocking this enzyme can be so important in reducing the potential of estrogen dominance.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the early 1940s, one experimenter implanted a very, very small dose of estrogen in animals that had their ovaries removed. The tiniest amount of uninterrupted estrogen produced cancer in every tissue. But if you interrupted it periodically, even a large amount of estrogen didn't lead to cancer the same as the aging rabbits or Hungarian women. The quantity and regularity of the progesterone interruption of estrogen just about completely protects the development of cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** So this is precisely why if women have multiple pregnancies, they are statistically much less likely to present with estrogen-related cancers.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And all of their tissues are stronger.

## Discovery and Mechanism of mTOR

tags: [[rapamycin]] [[mTOR]] [[kinase]] [[cancer suppression]] [[antibiotic]]

**Andrew Murray:** So getting on to what I think will take more than this month's discussion is the activity of this enzyme mTOR. It was described both ways: either the mammalian target of rapamycin or the mechanistic target of rapamycin. There are two subclades of mTOR: mTOR 1 and mTOR 2. I'd like to get into how what you have said for a long time now in terms of dietary advice, especially with emphasis on very small amounts of muscle meat and preferably not in isolation, and how dietary components which block mTOR as well as some drugs that have been used by pharmaceutical companies to block mTOR. So would you like to describe mTOR, its discovery, and what's happened?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** This particular antibiotic was used as a fungus killer. It's a broad spectrum, but especially effective against fungus. It happens to be in the same family of antibiotics as azithromycin and erythromycin. Those are known to have a very amazing spectrum of activity.

When people reported that COVID was being cured with a combination of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin, they were ridiculed because everyone said antibiotics only kill bacteria. But in fact this class of antibiotics happens to kill viruses as well as fungus. The actual knowledge about antibiotics and fungus and viruses was actively suppressed in favor of pharmaceutical special antiviral drugs which happen to be mutagens in general.

After it was discovered to be a great treatment for fungus infections, it was found to have many other effects—anti-inflammatory effects, which are very typical effects of that family. In exploring how the anti-inflammatory effect works, they found that it was acting on a particular kinase, an enzyme that attaches phosphate groups to particular enzymes and functional proteins. The phosphorylation directs it towards growth and inflammation. They found that the antibiotic inhibiting this particular kind of phosphorylating enzyme extended lifespan drastically and reduced cancer and inflammatory diseases.

The wastage of energy is one of the things in common with the inflammatory diseases, aging, diabetes, and cancer. The target of this antibiotic, rapamycin, which is also called sirolimus, in activating growth, controls the energy flow and an abundance of energy intake in general. Fats and proteins are the normal activators of mTOR complex number one. Growth hormone is a major activator of mTOR complex two, which is insensitive to the antibiotics.

For matters of diet and treatment, the attention is mostly on mTOR complex 1 because there are so many foods and substances that activate it and others that inactivate it. Not only methionine and some other essential amino acids activate mTOR—methionine is probably the main activator. But meat, for example, besides being a major source of methionine, it's also a major source of iron. And it happens that both iron and phosphate are activators of mTOR complex number one.

Milk, although it contains a lot of methionine, it happens that parathyroid hormone is an activator of mTOR, and milk's high calcium content, working with vitamin D, is the main thing that lowers parathyroid hormone. And so milk contains its own antidote working against the toxic effects of methionine, through the great concentration of calcium and a very low concentration of phosphate and iron.

## Dietary Activators and Inhibitors of mTOR

**Andrew Murray:** I'm glad you brought that up. So we can take calls from 7:30 until 8:00. We do have a caller on the line. Caller, what's your question?

**Michael (Caller):** I'd love a list of foods that both support bad mTOR and reduce it, as well as neutral foods. But also I learned a bunch about the metabolism of estrogen and the byproduct 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone and other pathways. I was curious for foods that would help men if they are converting their testosterone to estrogen, and also are there any foods that could get men to convert their testosterone to progesterone or also women?

**Andrew Murray:** How about that back conversion then?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think it can happen. Progesterone is a precursor to the glucocorticoids like cortisol, but it doesn't go down the pathway towards either testosterone or estrogen. The precursor to those is DHEA.

**Andrew Murray:** So how about the aromatase inhibitors or anything that you have as a kind of favorite in terms of potentially blocking.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just about everything that's good for you tends to inhibit the aromatase because it's activated by stress, cortisol, prostaglandins, for example, and inhibited by progesterone. All of the things associated with inflammation and degeneration, for example, angiotensin, which contributes to aneurysms, and all of the degenerative diseases work through mTOR. And so if you block angiotensin, you're helping to lower mTOR. All of the estrogens and estrogenic substances promote mTOR. Progesterone inhibits it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So do you think that even the weaker estrogens—because estradiol is the very strong one—so the estrone is weaker than estradiol? They all stimulate mTOR?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, they all add up to the same estrogen effect. But estradiol is at least 10 times stronger than the next—estriol, for example. It happens that progesterone activates the conversion of estradiol. If it exists and hasn't had the aromatase blocked by progesterone, the existing estradiol is prevented from being replaced. Progesterone activates the detoxifying enzyme. There's a whole system that adds either glucuronic acid or sulfuric acid to the estrogen so that it can be excreted. And it blocks the enzyme that would turn estrone into estradiol and favors the conversion of estradiol to estrone, the inactive form.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it's working on three different pathways to help block the estradiol, which is the most toxic carcinogenic inflammatory estrogen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several separate pathways that all coincide with an anti-estrogen effect of progesterone. Another mechanism is that progesterone breaks down the so called estrogen receptor.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And so do you recommend for men who are converting their testosterone into estradiol to use progesterone?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Coffee and progesterone and flavonoids. And aspirin is a major mTOR inhibitor and aromatase inhibitor.

**Andrew Murray:** So you're just saying essentially that most of what we would understand as anti-inflammatories will have that same blocking activity because it interrupts that cell cycle which leads to the inflammation and the promotion or increase conversion to those inflammatory estrogen products.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Not everything. For example, Tylenol, doctors have been taught to prescribe instead of aspirin. Aspirin has been demonized so that they can sell more Tylenol. But in fact, Tylenol activates mTOR, increases all of those inflammatory degenerative processes, and its antagonist—the antidote for Tylenol—is aspirin.

**Andrew Murray:** I should have couched that sentence with the anti-inflammatories that we recommend.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** I just want to mention that with these anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen and Tylenol, they actually increase your risk of stroke. They do not decrease it like aspirin does.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Just a little side note, because it's working at such a basic level, you really can't count the beneficial effects of aspirin.

**Michael (Caller):** And so would glutathione be as bad as methionine?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, too much glutathione activates mTOR.

**Andrew Murray:** I think when we first started talking about this as a subject, the two amino acids that principally seem to be activating it were methionine and leucine. I'd like to get into a discussion about calorie restriction and methionine restriction. But I also wanted to make sure that people listening understood that the term flavonoids is a very broad term for a lot of pigmented agents that color fruits and vegetables, and how supreme these flavonoids are at fighting cancers and being anti-inflammatory and directly blocking mTOR activity.

So I wanted just to mention that we've mentioned this before in context to COVID and the anti-inflammatory effects of some of these herbs. Things like EGCG—epigallocatechin gallate—from green tea, and caffeine. As Dr. Peat mentioned, another flavonoid that is useful for blocking mTOR as well as being generally anti-inflammatory is curcumin from turmeric, also an excellent blocker of those pathways.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Sorry, can I just interrupt you real quickly, Andrew, just for our listeners? We're talking about the flavonoids that are going to be blocking this carcinogenic substance called mTOR.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, so then the two other berberine-rich herbs are goldenseal and Oregon grapefruit. And then quercetin itself—actually one of the main sources is from onions, and that's probably why the onion syrup recipe is such a successful treatment for colds and coughs and mucus production.

Nettles and pomegranate are both good sources of quercetin. Orange juice obviously. And then resveratrol has received a lot of attention from Japanese knotweed and grape skins. Both of those are high sources of this compound. The Japanese pagoda tree, Sophora japonica, both the flowers and the fruits are very high in resveratrol.

There was a compound called pterostilbene which has been reported to inhibit mTOR when applied to isolated cells in culture. This stilbenoid chemical, related to resveratrol, is found in almonds, blueberries, huckleberries, cranberries, red grapes, and cocoa.

And then the last thing I wanted to mention from a herbal medicine perspective is a compound called fisetin—another flavonoid, found in very good concentrations in apples, strawberries, and persimmons—has been used successfully in the treatment of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers through the regulation of sirtuins.

The tenet of your 5 servings of fruit and vegetables comes from very much based in very good science and principally for the reason of the substances known as flavonoids that are found richly in them.

## Calorie Restriction vs. Glucose Metabolism

tags: [[glucose metabolism]] [[fat oxidation]] [[lactic acid]] [[carbon dioxide]] [[polyunsaturated fats]]

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Pete, from a calorie restriction perspective and a dietary perspective, what would be useful in being a low mTOR diet that would still allow growth? I know you say that when you're young you need all these calories, you need the fats and you need lots of protein because you're growing, but you don't need it when you get older. But how do you not turn into a walking skeleton? What do you think about calorie restriction and fasting and a diet that would be conducive for suppressing mTOR?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I don't think calorie restriction is necessary. What slows down the metabolic rate after 20? The rate of metabolism is only a fraction of what it was in childhood and then it continues falling with age, especially after the mid-40s. It's all downhill in metabolic rate. But the reason for that is the accumulation of polyunsaturated fats primarily, that shift our metabolism to prefer the oxidation of fat rather than glucose.

And if you are oxidizing glucose at a high rate, the resulting carbon dioxide is our basic anti-inflammatory substance. So the aim of all of this is to prevent the shift towards oxidizing fatty acids away from oxidizing glucose.

If you look at the metabolism of the degenerative diseases, especially diabetes, for example, the essence of diabetes is that you can't oxidize glucose and so you oxidize fat instead, resulting in the breakdown of glucose to lactic acid instead of carbon dioxide.

Lactic acid, for example, activates mTOR. And so the shift to oxidizing fat, which lots of people have been trained to achieve with the idea that you can prevent aging, obesity, and so on. But it happens that fat people tend to be oxidizing a higher proportion of fatty acids than glucose.

Cancer is the same. You fail to oxidize glucose and instead oxidize fatty acids, leading to inflammation. And instead of inhibiting mTOR with carbon dioxide, you activate it with lactic acid.

If you can keep away from the stress that causes you to oxidize the fatty acids preferentially, when you're oxidizing the alternatives to glucose, you are tending to support the secretion of growth hormone and the mTOR complex one, which is responsive to all of the rapamycin type inhibitors.

## Protein Sources and mTOR Management

tags: [[bone broth]] [[gelatin]] [[glycine]] [[glutathione]] [[protein sources]]

**Michael (Caller):** Since you're not calling in, how much glutathione would be too much in a day? And could you please list some protein sources similar to milk so that you could get a good dose of protein that you need without it pushing your mTOR up too much?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I think calcium is what makes the big difference between milk and other proteins.

**Michael (Caller):** So a bone broth sort of thing would be better?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, gelatin. Naturally extracted gelatin, like chicken skin and bone broth with the fat skimmed off, that contains a very low level of methionine and it contains the amino acid glycine, which has lots of other health benefits. So not only is it deficient in the mTOR stimulating amino acids, it's also pure glycine practically.

**Michael (Caller):** And how much glutathione? Because I know some people, including myself, actually take some supplemental glutathione as a liver antioxidant.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It's a reductant. And any of the reduced intracellular materials partly on the way to reaching the cell are likely to be oxidized by stray iron or copper atoms and so produce toxic things in the bloodstream before they ever get to the cell. But if you increase the reductive balance of cells, you're putting them in the worst kind of stress—the aging degenerative condition. Glutathione is the cell's major anti-free radical detoxifying agent. But to add it as a food is very risky and I think almost 100% likely to be harmful rather than helpful.

## Hormonal Pathways and Estrogen Detoxification

**Andrew Murray:** Well, thank you for that. I think the engineeer saying what he said has prompted people to call in. We've got a caller on the air. Let's take a caller. Where are you from? What's the question?

**Caller (Queens, New York):** Hi, I'm from Queens, New York. I have an off-topic question.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay.

**Caller:** I would like to know, Dr. Pete, what is your opinion on wisdom tooth extractions and root canals?

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Pete, did you hear that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, what was the question?

**Andrew Murray:** He was questioning what your opinion on wisdom tooth extraction and root canals was.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, I don't have anything about root canals. If the pulp is infected, it's probably good to clear to put in a safe filling material like calcium hydroxide and then let the immune system take over when you've cleaned out the infection. But I don't think it's good to pull any tooth that isn't an ongoing infection. If there's an infection that you can't clear up with a root canal, I think a good model of why it's something to avoid is if you pull a molar of a rat, giving it cognitive tests before the extraction and after, they lose cognitive ability just from the extraction of one molar. Because the brain is participating everywhere in the body. If you knock out muscle tension with Botox, for example, you've altered the brain and affected cognitive abilities. You can't really separate body metabolism from brain metabolism. And so the brain is involved in everything that goes on. And the more you can let the brain be responsible for governing the immune system, controlling the balance of inflammation and anti-inflammation, the better it is for the brain.

**Caller (Queens, New York):** I think I was asked like, what if—well, I currently have a wisdom tooth that has a really big cavity in it.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Dentists just don't like to fill cavities in wisdom teeth. It's so easy to extract them. But if you have, if you can control the pain by scraping out the decayed material and just sticking in a temporary so-called filling. For example, zinc and eugenol makes a plastic that hardens and is very easy to handle and reduces pain and stops infection. So your wisdom tooth probably isn't doing any biting work and a temporary filling probably would take care of it.

**Caller:** How do you clean it out?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A dental tool to break off any pulpy brown material. Scrape it until it's hard. A drill can be used, but just a steel probe just to scrape the tooth. In the case of doing a wisdom tooth that you aren't going to be using for chewing, then you can put the eugenol zinc filling in to control the pain and infection.

**Andrew Murray:** Out of interest, we found a very good holistic dentist in Oregon who we've been seeing for a while now who doesn't use injections. I've had a lot of dental work. He doesn't use injections to numb anything before he does a cavity. I've had two dental cavities done with him without injection. I'm amazed that all these years I've been subjected to probably brutal dentistry.

So I think I need to wrap up the show. I encourage you to find a good holistic or naturopathic dentist because they will take you on board as a patient and deal respectfully and kindly with you and not in a brutal, mechanistic way. So I'd encourage you to find a naturopathic dentist in New York. Just an aside there that we found a very good one in Oregon. Dr. Tanner is his name and he's in Medford, Oregon. If any of you are listening and you're in the Medford area, Dr. Tanner is an excellent guy.

**Andrew Murray:** Maybe he'd like to be an underwriter on KMUD.

**Andrew Murray:** Maybe so. Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Pete. I'll just put out add somebody else call it wanted contact information.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thanks.

**Andrew Murray:** Thank you. Okay, so for people who've listened to the show and not called in, Dr. Pete can be reached at www.raypeat.com, which has a website full of articles about many different subjects, fully referenced scientific articles based in science, not opinion. We can both be reached at www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com. Dr. Pete's been kindly giving his time on the third Friday of each month on KMUD.org in Garberville, California. So until the third Friday of March, wish you all the very best. We'll be beginning the March equinox at that time. So until the third Friday of next month, wish you all the very best.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thank you for listening. Good night.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Thanks.
