## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Welcome.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show, we run every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8 PM. You're invited to call in with any questions related to this month's topic of mitochondria, immunity, and natural resistance. Once again, we're very pleased to be joined by Dr. Raymond Peat to weigh in with his expertise on this subject.

The main thrust of tonight's show is going to be natural resistance and immunity, and we're going to discuss the role of mitochondria. There's some very interesting plant-based material which is responsible for the cell-stabilizing effect that we're going to describe and discuss in terms of stabilizing the cell and producing energy in the mitochondria. So Dr. Pete, we should probably start by asking you to describe your academic and professional background.

**Dr. Peat:** Okay. I didn't study biology professionally until about 12 years after graduating from college. I decided to go back and get a PhD at University of Oregon, 1968-72. Previously I had been working in literature, education, and various humanities areas. But finishing my PhD in physiology, I continued using the ideas I had researched and applied them to different fields, studying the brain in particular, reproductive hormones, and how nutrition interacts with development and health in general.

## Mitochondrial Oxidation and Plant Pigments

**Andrew Murray:** So for getting onto the topic of the first part of the show, I've looked at a wide range of natural products which have been studied and shown to be sources of mast cell stabilizers. In terms of the degranulation—the term given that mast cells undergo—in response to an allergen, which is the histamine-type-based reaction upon which inflammation is predicated, there are several different classes of compounds ranging from flavonoids to coumarins, things like cinnamic acid, and especially resveratrol and quercetin, which is a flavonoid found in citrus fruits and dark berries. I want to try and get a discussion going with you because I know you're interested in the energy potential of cells. We've mentioned before, medicinal plants like Lapacho or Tabebuia impetiginosa, otherwise known as Pau d'Arco, as well as Cat's Claw, which is Uncaria tormentosa. The Lapacho, which produces the compound lapachol from Tabebuia, a South American indigenous tree used in the treatment of cancers, as well as Cat's Claw, which is used in the treatment of Borreliosis from tick-borne Lyme's disease. Both of these, as well as all the other flavonoids, have very dark pigments. I've asked you in the past about the electrical potential of these pigments, and I know you've had a fairly clear answer for their benefits and how they're able to support various cell functions, as well as mitochondrial function in energy production through ATP. But both of these plants have very dark pigments. So do you have anything to say on the nature of the pigment and how that pigment acts electronically?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. When I was in graduate school, I was working on how oxidation, mitochondrial oxidation, relates not only to aging and fertility, but also to resistance against disease and development. Aging is a bad outcome of development, but development of the organism is something that's always happening. And when it's under the influence of oxidation, the outcome is constructive. When it's under the influence of something that blocks mitochondrial oxidation, the outcome is always bad. And it was already known in the 1960s that in general, purple pigments tended to promote better, more efficient oxidation.

I was always running around testing various plant materials, especially the purple and red ones. Several people observed that in general, red pigments tended to be sedating and blue pigments stimulating. But my main interest was in how the color related to the structure and why it improved mitochondrial oxidation. In the early years of the 20th century, Frederick Koch, a biochemistry and physiology professor at University of Michigan, found that a certain way of preparing a catalyst—he used a certain hot temperature of a platinum electrode to oxidize alcohol—produced a very intense deep blue or purple pigment that catalyzed mitochondrial physiology and function. Many years before the ubiquinone system was named—named because it's a quinone, which is ubiquitous in life—Frederick Koch was working on that chemical structure, which he knew to be a quinone. He hadn't even attempted to extract that material from cells; he just reasoned that it had to be there to catalyze oxygen.

It turns out this quinone that he was producing involved multiple double-bonded carbon-oxygen bonds that were resonating in relation to each other. The more you have in a sequence interacting with each other, the more powerful it is as an oxidant. After he was, in effect, chased out of the US by the FDA and FBI, he went to Brazil and studied natural plant substances there. Lapacho was one that he was interested in because of its color. And this turns out to be an analog of our own quinone system, the Coenzyme Q10 system, which is also very closely related to the vitamin K structure and the natural anti-inflammatory antibiotics, tetracyclines. They have a very intense system of conjugated double bonds analogous to these other natural activators of respiration. They happen to, in general, activate the production of energy as well as increase the consumption of oxygen.

But during the same period, going back about 70 or 80 years, it was known that anything that uncoupled—reduced the efficiency of energy production in the form of ATP—would make the oxygen system of the mitochondrion run faster and create a more oxidized state of the cell. This principle was used in diet pills because it would make you burn up fat quickly. But it was also found to intensify immunity in the sense of being able to detect and throw off cancer cells that were disseminated but not yet forming tumors. When you made the cells oxidize probably about 50 to 100% more intensely than normal by using this uncoupling chemical, the cancer cells would be attacked by the rest of the body, flare up, be thrown off, and fail to go ahead and produce a deadly cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** So this is in the presence of these quinones?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. This particular chemical, dinitrophenol, uses the nitro group, which is actually more toxic than the system the body uses—much riskier. A lot of people kill themselves trying to use that chemical for weight loss. But it illustrates the principle that when you run the system so it oxidizes more thoroughly, it does something to the immune system that resists both infectious organisms like bacteria. One of the changes that happens when you uncouple the cell and increase mitochondrial oxidation is that iron becomes safely put into a storage form, the ferric oxidized form. The opposite of that process happens when the cell has some obstruction to oxygen use. Many toxins and microorganisms can interfere with the use of oxygen. In that case, the iron is reduced electronically, goes into the toxic ferrous form, which creates very powerful free radical forms of oxygen—hydroxyl radical—which then damages everything in the cell. So protectively, the cell has this basic mechanism of increasing fever, for example, which will increase body temperature and oxidation by a natural form of uncoupling.

**Sarah Murray:** So going back to what you said, Dr. Pete, about iron and these quinone compounds found in things like Tabebuia, Pau d'Arco—do those also cause the body to put iron in a safer form rather than the very toxic form you mentioned?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, everything that maintains even the normal rate of cellular oxidation maintains a basic stable cell immune condition. And it's only when something has caused a dangerous disruption that the body has to resort to fever to increase that state and go back to its resting normal rate of good high oxidation.

## Mast Cell Stabilizers and Natural Compounds

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, so we were talking about the double-bonded oxygen structure and how this was relevant to the efficacy of these things as stabilizers and to produce the effect you just mentioned. Well, just in case people aren't familiar with the mitochondria—they are the machinery that generates energy, the natural progenitors of the energy. These are organelles that are part of a cell. And there are trillions of them, each manufacturing energy. But they essentially use food that's converted into a chemical called ATP, which is released by the mitochondria. Now, I don't want to just assume that this is how you understand mitochondria, because I know you've got some different interpretations of things we learned when studying these subjects. But essentially, whatever nutrients we eat increase the energy—electrons, as it were—in the form of a substance called NADH. And this is used by protein complexes to pump protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space of the mitochondria. This continuous pumping supposedly causes a proton-rich gradient where you've got positively charged protons attracted to a negatively charged matrix and going through this ATP synthase protein complex, which again, you may or may not subscribe to. And this is essentially what catalyzes the production of ATP. And it's this currency of energy which is used like thyroid, and they're probably hand in hand.

**Dr. Peat:** Thyroid hormone does increase the uncoupled oxidation of glucose, in particular raising the temperature. So when you're feeling maximally energized and efficient with good thyroid function, you aren't really being efficient in the sense of making a maximum number of ATP per oxygen, because running the oxygen through the system is maintaining a favorable balance of NAD—the oxidized form—to NADH. And when you block that thyroid function or any aspect of the system in the mitochondrion that consumes oxygen, blocking that, you pile up too much NADH—that's the reducing stress state of the cell.

These plant substances, a lot of them because of their hydroxy group rather than a double-bonded oxygen carbon group, have been considered to be nothing but antioxidants—vitamin C among them. But some of the flavonoids, for example, in the test tube look like antioxidants or reductants. Once they get inside the cell, they change their structure, lose the hydrogen, and create the quinone keto group—the double-bonded oxygen carbon—and become a catalyst then to maintain the oxidized state of the cell and lower the ratio of NADH to NAD.

**Andrew Murray:** Essentially, quercetin—for those people who've been looking at alternative approaches to treating COVID or prophylaxis, which is obviously the best way to go about this—is keeping your energy and cell stability good and thyroid function up and making sure you're in a healthy space physiologically. Quercetin was one of these flavonoids that has been mentioned in quite a few published medical journals along with hydroxychloroquine, which was mentioned early on in March and April. And one mentioned—I will mention the other compound—ivermectin, which actually is an antiparasitic. But getting back to quercetin, it was one of those three compounds used exactly for the cell-stabilizing effects. It's a compound found richly in citrus fruits and dark berries. And we talked about Pau d'Arco and the ubiquinone and quinone structure having this pigmentation. We find a lot of the flavonoids useful in stabilizing mast cells and preventing degranulation and the inflammation from histamine release and the cascade of events that produces vasodilation and bronchoconstriction and all the respiratory trouble that people can get into with regular coughs, colds, and influenzas—let alone coronavirus, however much more severe it is than regular flu.

But these flavonoids range from herbs well known—Dyer's Woad, which is Reseda luteola with the compound luteolin—and from olive, diosmetin, another good mast cell stabilizer. And apigenin is well-known in herb world from parsley, artichokes, chamomile, and oregano. And celery. And then genistein from ginkgo, which is a well-known platelet aggregation factor blocker used in allergies. And also EGCG—epigallocatechin gallate—from green tea, but also found in strawberries, blackberries, pears, peaches, and apples. And silymarin from milk thistle, another good flavonoid, and scopolein from oats, cherries. Then there were several other compounds from artemisias and angelicas that were mast cell stabilizers. Another range came from cinnamon—cinnamic acid was well reviewed—and ellagic acid from these pigmented berries: strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, cherries, walnuts. I wanted to talk about resveratrol, which has been used in an anti-Borreliosis approach from Polygonum cuspidatum, another very good mast cell stabilizer. And then turmeric from curcumin and parthenolide from feverfew. And then there was the sesquiterpene lactone family of compounds, from which spinach and lettuce, funnily enough, and chicory were well represented. And parsley and celery. So there are lots of natural compounds—some are flavonoids, some are phenols, some are terpenoids—but they are all plant-based compounds which are either pigment products like all the berries and the fruits, or they are just other compounds produced by these herbs.

## Lung Tissue, Inflammation, and Intestinal Health

tags: [[covid-19]] [[lung-inflammation]] [[intestinal-health]] [[fibrosis]]

**Caller David:** I tuned in late, but are you talking about a list of different herbs and plants that you were recommending? Was that specifically for prevention of COVID? Would that list make your tissue pucker up and make it harder for COVID to grab on? Is that the theory you're working on?

**Andrew Murray:** It was not specific to COVID at all—it was a very broad spectrum mast cell stabilizer. They are all cell-stabilizing compounds.

**David:** When I say pucker up, you're calling it stabilizing, which might be the same thing. Yeah, well, what I'm wondering about tied to that is: if COVID makes your lungs pucker up so much that they turn into dead coral—is there something that Pete, we could eat that would regain tissue in your lungs, fall off, and cough it out? You might be able to grow your lungs again if you ate right.

**Andrew Murray:** I think that actuality is extremely rare. But Dr. Pete, what do you think about the lung tissue damaging effects of COVID-19?

**Dr. Peat:** The spike protein creates the inability to overcome inflammation. So the inflammatory reactions are what killed a person with COVID infection. And the mast cells, for example, the plain old histamine reactions, prostaglandins—all of the familiar things that we suffer from with a mosquito bite or a bruise, almost any injury—it's exactly the same inflammatory system that goes wrong with COVID and also with cancer. So it shouldn't be surprising that a tremendous range of natural substances which have very parallel molecular arrangements will be beneficial in everything from mosquito bites to COVID or cancer or heart disease, because what they're doing is restoring the natural metabolism.

The fibrosis in the lungs results as the end product of chronic inflammation. So pneumonia caused by influenza or by smoking or by COVID virus—they all move towards the production of excess collagen and fibrosis and loss of proper lung function. One of the first places affected by the COVID virus, people will often get diarrhea and a cough associated with inflammation of the intestine caused by the virus even before it appears in the lung tissue. And the inflammation of the intestine causes a variety of toxins, including bacterial endotoxin, to get into the system. So you get necrosis that interferes with oxidative metabolism so that you stop producing carbon dioxide at a proper rate and start making pro-inflammatory lactic acid. And that leads to the inflammation in the lungs.

So one of the basic protective things to do is to make sure your intestine is not inflamed. And that includes avoiding any food that isn't properly digested. Enemas, laxatives, and fibrous foods—and even antibiotics to sterilize the intestine—should be part of any major, for example, surgery. They know that patients recover more successfully from major surgery if they have disinfected and cleaned their bowel, because any major trauma activates that whole systemic inflammatory process, starting with leakage from the bowel.

**Sarah Murray:** So really, I guess the answer to your question, caller, since we do have another caller, is that if you keep your intestines healthy, you keep your bowels working well, you'll have less inflammation in the lungs. So things like raw carrot salad, well-cooked mushrooms, taking laxatives like herbal laxatives such as cascara, and eating a generally healthy diet will help keep your intestines in optimum shape, which then means you'll be able to keep the inflammation down—since that's where a lot of the COVID and other pneumonia cold viruses start: in the intestine.

## Natural Resistance and Iron Regulation

**Caller:** I'm calling from Humboldt County. I'm a holistic health therapist. I treated myself with Echinacea and goldenseal extract, usually one drop of a thousand milligrams, and that protects me. I've never had COVID and it protects me like if I go shopping and get a sore throat or allergy symptoms. I take the drop, and sometimes I take another drop later if I have a sore throat or an allergy, which brings my immune system the soldiers to fight what can happen.

**Sarah Murray:** Echinacea and goldenseal are very good for your immune system.

**Caller (from Connecticut):** I'm calling from Connecticut and I have a question. There are a lot of products out there with bioflavonoids that you can get as supplements. I'm wondering about the delivery and bioactivity in that form versus finding them in foods. Is there any particular concern around the way they're processed? Or is there any significant difference in the overall activity of supplement concentrated form versus the ones in a food matrix that we get from food? Is there any value in buying those supplements?

**Andrew Murray:** I think, as always, especially for Dr. Pete's perspective, natural is best. And obviously fresh fruits—especially these dark pigmented fruits, the dark berries, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, grapes, and citrus fruits—are excellent sources of these flavonoids.

**Sarah Murray:** Plums, cherries.

**Andrew Murray:** But that's not to say that flavonoid-rich supplements don't work. I'm sure they do. It's just a case of eating for your health rather than consuming dietary supplements for your health. That's certainly the best way to go. Dr. Pete, what is your favorite flavonoid food source that has flavonoids in it?

**Dr. Peat:** Oh, considering the balance—many foods also have irritating substances or things that are hard to digest. And on balance, citrus juices have the best ratio of anti-inflammatory, pro-metabolic oxidation and nutrients. The flavonoids and ascorbic acid, for example, are all pro-oxidative metabolic supports, and the juice is very low in indigestible or pro-inflammatory substances.

**Caller (from outer galaxies):** I heard at the beginning of the program some conversation about what I would identify as the microbiome—the microbiome of the gut and the way that gut health affects overall whole body health. I'm a sufferer of Graves disease, Hashimoto's syndrome, as well as hyperthyroid. As a male, the way the pharmacologic corporations are set up, women are generally diagnosed with hypothyroid 84% of the time. Men are not, so everything in the spectrum for the hokey-pokey—let's mess around with petrochemicals. None of that works for me because my doctor gave me estrogen and serotonin as a mistake. My question is this: the application of black walnut tincture—that's what I use in order to stimulate my thyroid. I highly recommend it to anybody and everybody on the north coast because Fukushima Daiichi is affecting everyone's thyroid. Hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism—thyroid disease is on a major scale rise. I'd like to ask the clinician's opinion about the efficaciousness of black walnut tincture and their experience with that.

**Andrew Murray:** So far as black walnut tincture is concerned—Juglans nigra—the main use for that really is as an antiparasitic. The compound juglone has definitely been shown to be toxic to certain parasites, and so that's why it's been used for intestinal parasites. It's also been used or mentioned as a useful herb in thyroid disease because it does contain minerals like iodine and manganese. So that's potentially why people talk about it. But Dr. Pete's not very interested in too much iodine.

**Sarah Murray:** Dr. Pete, you've said that based upon the studies, very, very few people are low thyroid because of lack of iodine. It's actually quite rare, and actually too much iodine is very thyroid suppressive. Is that correct?

**Dr. Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah. So in that sense, black walnut would not be very useful because that would probably and potentially cause an increase in iodine that would not be favorable. Anyway, that was the feedback for black walnut as an antiparasitic. So until we get any next callers, I just wanted to talk about Ammi Visnaga, which is its common name—Khella—and it's actually an excellent plant-derived mast cell stabilizer. So if people want to look at Ammi Visnaga, it's been used actually for kidney disorders, but there's quite a lot of published research on it as a plant-derived mast cell stabilizer.

Obviously there are natural and synthetics, but basically we talked about the flavone groups that we mentioned here—things like apigenin, quercetin, and genistein. These things decrease the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines. And when they talk about cytokine storm, the last caller mentioned about the lung—the situation of the lungs becoming coral-like. Well, regardless of that, the lung damage induced by the unloading of all the chemicals as part and parcel of an inflammatory excitatory inflammatory response is what damages the tissue. And so these flavones do decrease the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and they decrease histamine.

**Sarah Murray:** Back to another thing: black walnut, like a lot of nuts, has selenium like Brazil nuts do, and that is pro-thyroid.

**Caller (rhubarb):** Plants are such a healing factor. Let me know what you think about rhubarb.

**Dr. Peat:** The famous Chinese rhubarb contains chemicals very similar to cascara and Lapacho and our intrinsic ubiquinone and our Coenzyme Q10. So it can be used medically. I think the root has been used medically more than the rest. The stems are a tasty food, but I don't think they have much of the purplish pigment material.

**Sarah Murray:** What about the red color in the pink rhubarb? We just cooked some up last night. Isn't that full of antioxidants?

**Dr. Peat:** I suspect that it is.

**Sarah Murray:** When you cook it down, it goes very red. If you have some nice red colored rhubarb stems.

**Andrew Murray:** I think the only negative thing to it perhaps is some of the oxalates it contains. But some spinaches do the same thing.

**Andrew Murray:** So Dr. Pete, you mentioned iron. I was looking at an article about iron's negative effects in the blood in terms of being pro-bacterial, in terms of multiplying bacteria in the presence of iron.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. Some of it floats freely dissolved in the blood plasma. And if a bacterium gets into your bloodstream, bacteria can use it to produce energy the same way we do. And so bacteria can thrive on the amount of iron normally in the blood. And the body protects itself by drastically reducing the amount of free iron circulating in the body fluids and binds it up in an oxidized form and holds it inside cells. And that's why a blood measurement of iron can't tell you very much. But if you measure the binding capacity and the amount of bound iron in the form of transferrin saturation, if the transferrin molecule is almost saturated with iron, that means your blood is great food for bacterial replication and overgrowth. So you want to have fairly low—like 20 to 30% saturation—that's a healthy range for resistance to bacterial infection and also apparently to cancer multiplication because iron is one of the things that cancer needs to multiply.

**Sarah Murray:** And that's one of the things I like to look at on clients' blood work. You mentioned 20% if you do an iron saturation. That's what you're referring to, right?

**Dr. Peat:** Yes. Because sometimes you'll see clients with 50% saturation in their blood and they usually are not doing well when they have that high a level of iron. Partly that's because it means the cell isn't oxidizing strongly enough to keep the iron strongly bound up inside cells.

**Sarah Murray:** So it's floating in the bloodstream and basically rusting things.

**Dr. Peat:** Becomes food for invaders.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, so I know you're very supportive of milk in the diet and eggs, but it was interesting that I saw an article talking about lactotransferrins from milk and ovalbumin from egg white as being very good at binding iron and lowering iron in the serum.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. Eggs have been found to be both antibacterial and antiviral, especially in a raw form like an eggnog. They have found that where other forms of lecithin stimulate bacterial or viral growth, the lecithin from egg yolk has a bactericidal and virucidal effect.

**Andrew Murray:** So this would support the kind of athletes' recommendation of drinking a couple of eggs whisked up with a glass of milk, right?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay. So I wanted also to mention the fact that I saw an article again which mentioned how much the serum concentration of iron is lowered during fever, and that potentially this is probably one of the body's natural responses to fever, perhaps induced by bacterial infection. That would be kind of an appropriate response.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. And the thyroid in good health—the thyroid is doing that all by itself. But when the body is threatened, it can go into that uncoupled, highly oxidative state defensively, and then when the threat is over, it can go back to relying on thyroid to maintain the high metabolic rate.

## Closing

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, we should probably leave it there because it's getting late. So thanks so much for your time again, Dr. Pete. And we'll give out your details.

For people who have listened to the show or want to listen to it later, the audio archives are freely available. Go to kmud.org, go to audio archives, and Friday Night Talk is the name of the show. So look at the Friday Night Talks for the third Friday of each month. We have all of most of last year's and a few of this year's shows. Everything up until including the beginning of 2020 is on our website at www.westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

For those people interested in addition to Dr. Pete and wanting to find out more about him, go to www.raypeat.com. There's fully referenced material on his site about many different conditions, most of which people can easily self-treat through nutrition and the substances that are recommended. Although it's not a big pusher of dietary supplements by any means.

For those people who've listened to the show, the next month—the third Friday in June—will be the next time we'll be on. Western Botanical Medicine is the name of our business, and we both practice natural alternative medicines and have a degree from England in herbal medicine, licensed there to diagnose and prescribe.
