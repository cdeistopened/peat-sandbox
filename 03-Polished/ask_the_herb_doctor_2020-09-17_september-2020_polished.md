## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Welcome to our show this evening.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who perhaps have never listened to the show, we run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 PM. We are both registered medical herbalists. I graduated from England and Sarah graduated from England with a master's degree in herbal medicine.

We produce and manufacture extracts of different herbs that are used commonly in Europe as herbal medicines. We want to establish the truth in these monthly radio shows surrounding alternatives to the regular medicines, just so people have alternatives to look at and examine for themselves.

We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us.

**Andrew Murray:** Well, thanks for joining us again. Before I go into the introduction to this month's lineup—we've got questions for you and new evidence, just trying to get to the bottom of all of this and find the truth—would you just outline your professional and academic background for people listening who perhaps have not heard of you before?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** From the University of Oregon in 1960, I got a master's degree in a humanities-related subject. Then in 1972, a PhD in biology concentrating on physiology, especially reproductive physiology and aging. And since 1972 I've been writing and studying and doing some counseling.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, well, very good. And for those people that are listening both now and at the end of the show, I'll give out your information, Dr. Peat, so people can find out more for themselves: www.raypeat.com. There's lots of articles written by you, fully referenced. And as I said at the beginning of the show, listen and you hear me, you'll know the truth and the truth will set you free.

## COVID-19 Lab Origin and Engineering

tags: [[covid-19]] [[wuhan-lab]] [[gain-of-function]] [[virus-engineering]]

**Andrew Murray:** I wanted to preface the introduction for this month by saying that it's not for pointing the finger of blame, but for the freedom which knowledge can bring. Is the Internet a platform for destabilizing central control and disseminating information in the objective scientific form, which is impartial and non-political? I've always quoted in these monthly radio shows from time to time since they started with KMUD back in 2004: "He who has ears to hear, let him hear." There are many crying out in the wilderness, as it were, of the World Wide Web, battling censorship and oppression to tell the truth. None more so than the people of China under the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party with its self-proclaimed lockstep mentality—the Tiananmen Square massacre being the pivotal point beginning this tragic oppression and government control of a beautifully poetic, creative, intelligent, and skilled nation's people.

Information and knowledge cannot be silenced in a free world or democracy, protecting its inalienable and sovereign rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as enshrined in our constitution. With this in mind, the revelation this week of Dr. Li Meng Yen—an MD and PhD scientist working in the Hong Kong School of Public Health who has since fled to the US to escape persecution from the Chinese Communist Party—is significant. She's saying that COVID-19 was engineered in the Wuhan laboratory. This is revelational, although we have heard from other people about this, like Dr. Luc Montagnier, the Nobel Prize winner throughout his discovery of AIDS. But it's not the first time that this has been alluded to. Dr. Luc Montagnier, the Nobel Prize winner for finding AIDS, has posited that COVID has been genetically altered and has some elements of malaria and HIV in its genome, and that perhaps the researchers in Wuhan were attempting to create a vaccine for AIDS.

The National Biosafety Lab in Wuhan specializes in different coronaviruses and since the early 2000s has done the same. So not for blaming China, but to navigate these waters we as a species now find ourselves faced with—and to cover the actual mortality of this disease and how this event is profoundly affecting our freedom and association—that's the reason we're doing this.

Dr. Peat, before we started, can I just go back to somewhat the beginning, in April, to that Nobel Prize winner, Dr. Luc Montagnier's interview on French TV. I know it had subtitles because I don't think he speaks English, but it was in French. He was saying it was quite clearly genetically altered, and that revelation blew my mind when I heard it. You know, he's a Nobel Prize winner, not a conspiracy theorist. So as I said in the beginning, just the facts so we can have the truth and the truth can set us free. What do you think of the reference to those two diseases in the genome? Because some people on the Internet will say, well, there are other coronaviruses that have elements of malaria and HIV in them. I mean, is that possible?

**Dr. Peat:** Oh, naturally. When someone prominent like that points out how easy it is to engineer such a virus, people jump on it and say, no, it isn't possible to create it in the lab. Earlier, a couple months earlier, I think, when people were talking about it coming out of a germ warfare lab or being deliberately released, some of the people involved in working on the virus immediately published a paper in Nature. Nature serves as, in many ways, the voice of the establishment—military establishment and secret government establishment. But they published a paper claiming that it was impossible to create that particular virus in a lab.

But I had been reading for a long time publications coming out of the University of North Carolina lab of Ralph Baric. He was describing in detail the changes that they made in coronaviruses and other similar viruses, and specifically how to make them more infectious to humans—changing an animal virus to a virus that would be infectious in humans. So Luc Montagnier simply applied his knowledge of virology and quickly could demonstrate the specific changes that had been made.

**Andrew Murray:** This is directly opposing the Geneva Convention, right? When they outlawed biological and other weapons.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, Richard Nixon was one who closed the germ warfare lab in the United States in 1969. And there was a general treaty recognition around the world that no one would continue designing lethal viruses for military use. But they immediately started saying that just in case someone violates the convention and does produce one, we need to have a vaccine ready. So we'll have to make these extremely dangerous viruses so we can practice making a vaccine. Even though historically, for decades, people have been trying to make a vaccine against common cold viruses, never succeeded because the viruses change so fast.

The story that they were having to make toxic, human-infecting viruses out of animal viruses so they could make a vaccine in case someone else made them—at best, there were 200 virologists who signed a letter saying, "This is crazy," because even with the best precautions, accidents happen. In fact, in the Fort Detrick lab, I think there were a thousand accidents identified which could have leaked toxic viruses into the environment. They happen every few days, even in these highest security labs. Someone forgets to turn a valve or clean the pipes or put on a mask or whatever. But the accidents are essentially unavoidable.

So if you're designing what they call "gain of function research"—a virus that never could infect mammals or humans, for example—they find out what viruses, how the viruses that do infect humans use to become infectious, and then they simply take the genes creating those proteins and insert those genes into some virus that produces the symptoms they want to produce. So it's very standard gene engineering. There's nothing impossible about pretty much making any DNA sequence you want. You can change one base at a time, or you can take a block of genes out of a virus and transfer that as a block. So the engineering is all very well standardized and known around the world.

**Andrew Murray:** I wonder how on earth is it allowed, though? Because it sounds like exact contravention of the Geneva Convention, doesn't it?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, there are—I forget how many—of these labs around the world. The Republic of Georgia has a big one similar to the Wuhan lab or the North Carolina lab, one of the African countries, I forget which—Nigeria or one country. A very strange place to be making toxic viruses. But I think Romania is another country that has a lab where you would be very surprised that they had the technology to work at that level or any reason to do so.

## Long-Term Health Consequences

tags: [[pathophysiology]] [[inflammation]] [[serotonin]] [[lung-damage]]

**Sarah Murray:** Well, isn't that why Dr. Fauci went to Wuhan in the first place, was because the US Government didn't want him doing that type of research and experiments?

**Dr. Peat:** After those 200 virologists said there should be some serious thought given to this practice, there was a moratorium placed and almost immediately Fauci transferred technology to Wuhan.

**Sarah Murray:** Okay, so if this coronavirus COVID-19 was engineered in a lab in Wuhan and it has gene sequences from AIDS and malaria and who knows what else, what do you think about people getting sick with it? Do you think there's going to be long-term consequences?

**Dr. Peat:** It has turned out to be slightly more infectious than a standard flu or cold virus—definitely more infectious, but not really much more harmful in the sense of killing people.

**Sarah Murray:** Well, could there be any long-term effect because they've altered this virus?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, all of the things like influenza that create serious respiratory disease—these respiratory viruses, the coronaviruses and influenza—these all create inflammation in the lungs and throughout the body. The clotting diseases that they have claimed are specific to coronavirus—that's been knowledge for I think about 30 years that people after an attack of influenza are more likely to have a stroke or other blood clotting event, heart attacks and strokes, because of the inflammation in the lungs. Inflammation damages the lungs' ability to detoxify hormones.

For example, almost all of the body's inflammation-creating serotonin travels from the intestine through the blood to the lungs. A little bit is detoxified in the liver, but most of it is destroyed in a healthy lung, stopping the inflammatory process that excess serotonin could cause. But if you knock out your lungs' ability by inflaming them with influenza, then the serotonin goes on to cause vascular spasms, clots, various kinds of inflammation throughout the body.

All of the strange things that have been blamed on coronavirus, it's simply the result of seriously inflamed lungs. And for some reason, the standardized reaction imposed from above on hospitals was to quickly give respiratory pumping—slightly higher concentration oxygen directly into their lungs. And when you accelerate breathing, increase the oxygen delivery to the lungs, that in itself creates inflammation, reduces the lungs' ability to detoxify serotonin, leads to all of the inflammatory things getting worse.

So the extremely high mortality rate in the early weeks, when they were practically in some hospitals putting a tube into all of the COVID-diagnosed patients, they were having from 60 to 100% mortality in those hospitals. But in nearby hospitals where they had someone actually thinking about what's needed when you have inflamed lungs, they had essentially zero mortality, showing that almost 100% of the mortality was caused by ignorant application of these respirators.

## Comparative Mortality and Death Certificate Fraud

tags: [[mortality-statistics]] [[death-certificates]] [[cdc-data]] [[comorbidities]]

**Sarah Murray:** So do you think that this COVID-19, because it's been genetically engineered in a lab, do you think it's more dangerous than just a normal coronavirus or influenza, or do you think it causes the same amount and the same type of damage in the lungs as the normal flu?

**Dr. Peat:** The rate of deaths per infection are very slightly higher than influenza, but it's something that you have to look very hard to find. The greater mortality per infection, it's impractical since it's just a bad flu season. The whole panic has no basis at all when you consider the unemployment and loss of businesses is going to increase mortality from other causes. That very, very small increase in respiratory disease mortality is dwarfed by the harm you're doing to the world population by knocking out the economy.

**Sarah Murray:** So in a bad flu year—I think it was like 2017—88,000 people died of influenza and that was considered a bad year. And now Worldometer says there's 203,000 deaths from coronavirus or this COVID-19. But we don't really know if that's all COVID-19. Even Deborah Birx said that there's going to be a percentage of those deaths that are being labeled. The CDC—Deborah Birx said there's a percentage of those 203,000 deaths that are the other types of influenza that kill people every year. So when you say it's just a little bit slightly worse than a bad flu year, are you taking that into consideration?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, the instructions given for filling out death certificates and for diagnosing—there is really no clear definition of how to tell when someone is sick from the coronavirus or whether the coronavirus is simply incidental to some other cause of their pneumonia and sickness. But by the instructions they were given, if there was evidence of the presence of a virus and the person died, then you had to disregard that they died of a car accident or cancer or heart disease or bacterial pneumonia. If they died and had the presence of the coronavirus, they were said to have died from coronavirus. Absolutely unscientific, unmedical.

**Sarah Murray:** Well, the CDC also came out with, in the last month, a statistic saying that 94% of coronavirus fatalities or COVID-19 fatalities—deaths were actually comorbidities. The people who died had heart disease and/or diabetes and other conditions, chronic disease that could have killed them. And they weren't 100% sure if it was a COVID-19 death.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, when you look at the phony diagnosis of death cause, it looks like it might not even be as harmful as a standard influenza virus. It's hard to tell because there's no science being done. It's all political decisions.

**Sarah Murray:** So I guess we just have to wait until all the information is out and all the figures are out, and then you look at the excess mortality and ask, "Did more people die in 2020 than in 2019, 2018?" You know, look at it for years back and compare. Is that what you basically think is the only way to know?

**Dr. Peat:** Normally the CDC has taken two weeks for years past. Within two weeks, the death figures coming in from around the country had been compiled and remained stable. But the first few months of 2020 showed many fewer people dying from all causes in the US, and then in mid-summer the CDC went back and altered figures as far back as 25 weeks and raised the death figures so that they conformed to the usual preceding years. But until they did that—historically unprecedented long-range revision of history—fewer deaths had occurred in the US than in a normal year.

**Sarah Murray:** So basically we won't really know because if they're able to alter the figures that way, how do we know any of the figures are true at all?

**Dr. Peat:** That's my opinion.

## Connective Tissue Repair and Hormonal Balance

tags: [[connective-tissue]] [[rotator-cuff]] [[platelet-rich-plasma]] [[hormone-balance]] [[vitamin-d]]

**Caller:** I'm from the East Coast. Just one comment on your line of discussion and then I have a separate question. The lady was right in China that it was released there. But there's a patent in 2003. This has been worked on for more than a decade. In 2007, they changed the patent to make it private. And as Dr. Pete alluded to, in 2015, when they shut down the Fort Detrick lab, they moved it and they funded Wuhan with $3.7 million. This has been premeditated for more than a decade.

**Sarah Murray:** Yes, and we did discuss that at one of our earlier coronavirus shows.

**Caller:** So the lady's half right, but it's plausible deniability for both countries. Anyway, my question relates to something I've not found on any of your information. It relates to a tear of a tendon, which actually connects a muscle with a bone. In particular, I know someone with two rotator cuff tears—a partial tear in one of the rotator cuff muscles and another full tear. And so he's in his mid-60s. As a result, with lack of arm mobility, if you don't actually move it around, you can actually get what they call frozen shoulder. And even in the absence of surgery, it can take from one to three years to get even partial recovery. So my question relates to whether you've had any experience with folks that have had these types of injuries.

And just a point on the current technology for surgery is to incorporate a suture which stays in there the whole time, and a non-metal connector which I believe is some plastic material that goes into the bone so that you can connect the tendon to the bone so that over time it will reattach. But absent that, it'll never reattach. So I'm just wondering whether in the circumstances for current technology, you have any views on having a suture in a non-metal plastic piece forever for the rest of your life versus just doing nothing and keeping it detached, or both of them partially.

**Andrew Murray:** How about this, Dr. Pete? What do you think of platelet-rich plasma?

**Dr. Peat:** If a person is in perfect health when some kind of unusual accident causes that rotator cuff injury, then surgery has a pretty good chance of making a permanent repair because the tissues are strong and can tolerate the implanted materials. But usually it happens when the person is in their 40s or 50s and is experiencing hormonal changes, increased stress hormones that weaken the connective tissues.

There are treatments such as platelet-rich plasma that will stimulate fibrous tissue growth. But I think the essential thing is to restore the hormonal balance that builds healthy connective tissue—get the ratio of cortisol to the protective DHEA, testosterone, and progesterone and pregnenolone down. Lower that ratio of cortisol so that the connective tissues repair themselves rather than being weakened by the stress hormones.

I've known, I guess, half a dozen shoulder people, some knee people, and various other connective tissue diseases such as uterine prolapse, hernias in various places—midline or groin hernias. Rather than having to implant a plastic or metal repair material, if they get their anti-stress system back—sometimes just taking adequate amounts of vitamin D will toughen up the connective tissues. Vitamin D works on the fascia and tendons and ligaments as well as the bones, toughening everything and helping to keep things in their proper place.

**Sarah Murray:** So I just want to tell everyone listening: it's vitamin D—like the sunshine hormone.

**Caller:** Not by the way, let me just ask a follow-up. So they also mentioned to them that a cortisone shot would be good because initially after the injury the inflammation on an MRI was extremely obvious. And you've discussed the negatives of cortisone. So to your earlier point, applying progesterone in a 5 or 6 to 1 ratio with DHEA on the location and maybe putting CO2 gas over the area might be alternatives to try to get the inflammation down. Are these the right methods or are there other things that should be done? Or do you think a cortisone shot in this instance may be appropriate?

**Dr. Peat:** No, anti-inflammatories are safer than cortisol or the synthetic glucocorticoids that they use, which are even worse than cortisol. But getting enough into the tissue is the essential thing. And usually these people have supplemented them orally as well as anointing the areas very thoroughly—the arm, the shoulder, the torso, around the injured area, for example, or the whole leg in the case of the knee.

But getting the body level up to the point that your natural stress-induced cortisol isn't going to be counteracting the healing process—testosterone supplements can contribute to the process if they're balanced with vitamin D and thyroid hormone and anti-inflammatories.

**Caller:** So the topical thing you were talking about was the progesterone combination I was talking about or some other substance?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. People have generally used a mixture of progesterone and DHEA, sometimes with testosterone when that was available.

**Caller:** Well, I'm using it without it. I mean, it's actually like six, seven to one, because I guess topically you gotta get 10 times the amount, I guess. But I don't know if that's the right ratio or whether it matters. But I'm a little concerned that if you're older, like if you're over 60, that the conversion to estrogen with the DHEA is a problem. Because there's no doubt that anybody over 60, maybe other than you, is clinically hypothyroid.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. That's the reason for making sure that your vitamin D and calcium intake and thyroid hormone are all adequate to keep your estrogen under control so that you don't turn your DHEA and testosterone into estrogen.

**Caller:** Okay, so just a last confirmation—I'll let you go and I appreciate the clarity of your answer. So if there's only one technique that's used today by the best doctors and that is to put some sort of non-metal piece into the bone and have a suture in there where literally they both remain there for the rest of your life, you're not troubled by the fact that maybe it disintegrates or maybe something else?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, that's exactly the problem. Dental implants are the same idea. You have to look at the hormonal situation. Some people have very, very bad results from implanting anything. If you're in good health generally, you might be able to tolerate implants without symptoms.

**Sarah Murray:** But I've also heard that when people have their ligaments detached around their knee, that surgery is only 50% effective. So half of the people who have detached ligaments heal up just fine, so they must reattach. And half the people who get the surgery do good on it and half don't. So that must be possible. Statistics like that come out.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. In connection with the ligament detachment, if a thing is immobilized and kept in proper relationship to the bone, regrowth is going to happen. Things spontaneously grow together.

## Masks and Respiratory Protection

tags: [[masks]] [[n95]] [[micron-size]] [[respiratory-protection]]

**Andrew Murray:** Between Luc Montagnier, Nobel Prize winner, saying this virus is engineered, and Ralph Baric's lab in North Carolina saying the spike protein had definitely been altered, the latest to come to the fore is Dr. Li Meng Yen, a virologist in Hong Kong who has blown the whistle online. Her name is Li Meng Yen—you can type her name into YouTube. There was a Fox News interview with Tucker Carlson and a Loose Women post where British public figures and newscasters were interviewing her. She said categorically that it was manufactured and that she was threatened to be silenced or "disappeared." She is about to release verifiable evidence that this virus was indeed engineered. She says the Chinese Communist Party is completely behind silencing this.

Okay, there's another issue that just came out. Dr. Lee Merrick has an interview, actually a video, talking about the futility of wearing masks. Last month we did a show on this question—the micron size of coronavirus is far smaller than an N95 mask can filter out. So you're going to get not only respired particles through the mask, but N95 masks are not proper bacteriological respirators. They leak air from the nose and around the folds. And they are not at all patent or competent.

**Dr. Peat:** A simple cloth mask is even worse because the cores are gigantic in comparison to the size of the virus, which is one-eighth of a micron in diameter. Recently, smoke exposure has been causing increased sickness and probably death from heart disease, respiratory problems, asthma, and kidney disease, overlapping greatly with things blamed on viruses. The smoke particles that are most toxic are just the size of the coronavirus and smaller, all the way down to about a tenth the diameter of even the coronavirus.

So for big particles of soot or dust, an N95 mask is very helpful. But for even average-sized bacteria and especially the sub-micron size of the coronavirus and smoke particles, they do very little to protect you.

**Caller:** Does wearing a mask reduce spread?

**Dr. Peat:** There is no scientific evidence it does. So I would say no. But in waiting for further research, it's a possibility that it does. But in the absence of evidence, there were, I think, 17 properly controlled studies, properly interpreted on the right sort of populations with honest evaluation at the end. All of those 17 have failed to produce any evidence.

**Caller:** If you have to wear a mask to go into a store, are cloth masks safer than N95?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. The problem with using a barrier like a mask to increase your CO2—if you have a breathing tube, that can be therapeutic because it doesn't increase the pressure. But the problem with a barrier, especially an N95 mask—when you inhale, you have great resistance sucking air through that fine-poured filter and blowing it out, then you increase the pressure. You have alternating vacuum and pressure on your lungs. That alternating pressure creates inflammation in itself.

**Caller:** My name's Mike. Is a vapor mask for painters with cloth over it of any value compared to what a painter's mask is?

**Dr. Peat:** Particles of sub-micron diameter are the main thing causing lung disease—both viruses and particles such as soot, silica, metal powders, oxides, and so on. All of those cause serious systemic and especially lung inflammation. But when you're around chemical fumes, a carbon filter is very, very helpful. If you have a very good, big carbon filter that's going to take the chemicals out—but not the particles.

## Anti-Inflammatory Treatments

tags: [[hydrogen-gas]] [[hydroxychloroquine]] [[vitamin-d]] [[inflammation]]

**Caller:** Bruce from Garberville. What does Dr. Pete think of the inhalation of Brown's gas or hydrogen gas inhalation or drinking it in infused water?

**Dr. Peat:** Breathing hydrogen gas is anti-inflammatory. I think the right percentage of carbon dioxide is the most important thing. Since we make our own carbon dioxide, avoiding hyperventilation or being dosed with concentrated oxygen is the first thing to consider. But breathing a little hydrogen is anti-inflammatory.

**Andrew Murray:** I saw a retraction in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet. They retracted their statement that hydroxychloroquine was ineffective in the treatment of COVID. It turned out that the company that conducted the research, called Surgispheres, could not and would not present their dataset for external audit. That raised the question of the validity of the information and they retracted the statement. What do you think about hydroxychloroquine in and of itself?

**Dr. Peat:** The actual science shows that it's anti-inflammatory and is helpful for a great variety of kinds of disease, including viruses and inflammation. Parasites such as malaria all cause damage by creating inflammation. And hydroxychloroquine is protective against all of those inflammations. Not that it's the best one, but it definitely hasn't increased mortality by 10%. Any editor should be expected to send a draft of an article to competent people—for example, respiratory specialists. Any respiratory specialist looking at the data would know there was something phony. There was a huge database that had never been cited before. Any competent researcher would know that and would ask where that database originated and would have immediately found that it was a complete invention and fraud.

**Andrew Murray:** I also wanted to say this: a study was done on COVID patients showing that those patients with a higher than 30 nanogram per milliliter blood level serum level of vitamin D did significantly better than those who had a level of 20 or below, which were positively correlated with increased death. You agree with that, correct?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. Vitamin D is one of the most important opponents of inflammation. It directly prevents the types of inflammation caused by particles or coronavirus or influenza and any infection, in fact.

## Closing
