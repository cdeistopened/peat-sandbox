## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Well, welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Murray:** And my name's Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who've perhaps never listened to the shows before, they run every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 PM with questions and a live call in from 7:30 until the end of the show at 8 PM. As has become the custom here, we have Dr. Raymond Peat joining us. And this month's topic is going to be small intestinal bacterial overgrowth with an overview of gastrointestinal motility and the common problems that many patients experience—from chronic constipation through diarrhea—and some of those things that can be used to diagnose and treat the condition. If you are interested in calling in from 7:30 on, the number is 707-923-3911.

So once again, we're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us and to share his expertise. Dr. Peat, thanks so much for joining us this month again. So for this June episode, June 2021, just for posterity, would you let people know your academic and professional background for perhaps those people who tuned in just now who may not have heard of you before?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I was studying and working in humanities—literature, painting, various schools—and I decided to go back to graduate school in biology and physiology in 1968 and got my PhD at University of Oregon in 1972. And since then I've been doing writing about physiology and counseling individuals and doctors about hormones, physiology, and nutrition.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay. I know there's a wealth of information on your website, which we will give out at the end of the show for people who want to find out more about you. Having been guided by your work for 11 or 12 years now, I was just thinking over the previous years that we've done radio shows with you and spoken with you—having been very interested in the gut as a seat of good health. The ancients always talked about the seed of health being the digestion and assimilation. And back in the very early times with the four humors and diagnosis of disease, the rudimentary alimentary tract and its assimilation of food and excretion of waste has long been connected with health and ill health.

## Introduction to SIBO and FODMAP

tags: [[sibo]] [[fodmap]] [[digestive-health]] [[ancient-medicine]]

I wanted just to go over what is known now. I think it's been for maybe 20 years, but maybe only in the last five years has there been a significant increase in the diagnosis of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth as a defined pathology which people suffer with. And over the last 20 years, I've certainly spoken and consulted with a lot of people with gastrointestinal disturbance—either ranging from constipation or diarrhea or alternating IBS type, irritable bowel syndrome type digestive complaints. And I know you've mentioned for many different pathologies that serotonin is being a causative inflammatory mediator. And that's also been very enlightening in terms of serotonin. In the common conception or the media conception that most people know about serotonin, they think there's a positive hormone, but actually it's very inflammatory. So I'd like to question you and get your feedback on your understanding of the pathogenesis and development of SIBO. And just to say that they classify at this point in time SIBO-C for constipation and SIBO-D for diarrhea. And there's a list of foods called the FODMAP Guide, to which I'd like to ask questions also because I know that some of the foods you're very interested in and specific with dietary requirements for people wanting to get better health. And a lot of things that people eat now that they're told are healthy for them—especially any of those PUFAs that you've been rallying against for a long time now—and the seeds and nuts and those kinds of foods appear on a FODMAP list. The FODMAP breaks down to fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and then the polyols, the sugar alcohols. So before we get into those kinds of foods, what do you understand and how much relevance do you give to this type of SIBO with patients that are complaining of diarrhea or complaining of constipation? And what's your approach to it?

## SIBO, Digestion, and Small Intestinal Health

tags: [[sibo]] [[digestion]] [[fodmap]] [[fermentation]] [[small-intestine]]

**Dr. Peat:** Everything depends on digestion. If you aren't digesting it properly, then problems occur. And some people warn against the FODMAPs as causing problems because they ferment. Others promote exactly the same carbohydrates and oligosaccharides and so on, just because they do ferment and release short chain fatty acids—acetate, butyrate, and propionate in particular. And one doctrine says that those are beneficial, stimulating things that prevent bowel cancer and so on. Others point out that each one of those is a very serious potential toxin, and we do absorb them. And acetate, acetic acid, butyric acid, and propionic acid all have their potential value, but they are also very well known as toxins.

So generally I'm inclined to side with the people that prefer not to eat the things which can increase those potentially toxic short chain fatty acids. Because you can get all your nutrients with things that are resistant to fermentation. The sugars, if you have normal digestive actions, should be absorbed very high in the small intestine, just shortly after leaving your stomach. They should be absorbed in that area. In very healthy people, the stomach and the whole small intestine are sterile. The sicker a person is, the farther up the small intestine from the colon—the farther up the bacteria and other microbes can invade and set up housekeeping. And some people with very weak digestion will actually have fermentation going on in their stomach. So if they eat sugar or carbohydrate, they can get drunk and have alcohol production going on right in their stomach.

**Andrew Murray:** Interesting. You said the small intestine could or should be sterile in comparison to the colon, which we recognize as being the major production, proliferative, and populated area compared to anything else you can think of. But you're saying that the small intestine should essentially be relatively sterile?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. The very healthy—something like 15 or 20% of the population who are very healthy—have a sterile small intestine. And the sicker a person is, it tends to increase with age as the metabolic rate slows down. The farther up in the small intestine, you find more and more bacteria living closer and closer to the stomach as a person develops poor digestion.

**Sarah Murray:** If 20% of people have a sterile intestine, what should the rest of us do? Eighty percent of the population that doesn't have a sterile small intestine—what are we to do to help keep the bacterial overgrowth down in our small intestine?

**Dr. Peat:** Do you remember Dennis Burkitt who studied the diet effects and a particular type of tumor in Africa? He popularized the use of a high fiber diet in the US when he reported on the health benefits of the African diet and pointed out that Africans on their typical diet have a 12-hour transit time, whereas the average American has a 72-hour transit time—half a day versus three days for something to get processed and get out of you. And so naturally, the African with the very short duration doesn't give putrefaction or fermentation a chance to go very far. And the famous people who popularized yogurt in the diet as a way to suppress putrefaction—e.g., Metchnikoff and Bogomolets—early in the 20th century and end of the 19th century, they studied different animals that had short or long lifespans. And they argued that the animals with a short intestine, a colon that just very quickly eliminated and didn't store for a long time the processed food—those were the long-lived animals. Those with a long intestine and long retention of the putrefying material in the intestine were shorter-lived.

## Hypothyroidism, Parkinson's, and Serotonin

tags: [[serotonin]] [[parkinson's]] [[hypothyroidism]] [[dopamine]] [[inflammation]]

**Andrew Murray:** So I saw hypothyroidism as one of the predisposing factors to SIBO in the population, along with things like chronic pancreatitis and motor disorders like Parkinson's disease and fibromyalgia. And I saw IBS and fibromyalgia were fairly intimately linked. And there was cause for investigating gastric or intestinal dysmotility with fibromyalgia patients. But Parkinson's—that's interesting from a motor neuron perspective in terms of slowing muscular contraction along the GI tract for the constipatory side of it.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. I think it's the constipation leading to the neurological problem. And traditionally they've been thinking of Parkinson's disease as a deficiency of dopamine. But dopamine and serotonin are an antagonistic pair. And really the evidence, I think, more strongly indicates that Parkinson's is related to a serotonin excess than just a dopamine deficiency. And a few people have argued that serotonin can't get from your intestines to your brain. But there is actual evidence that if you have an excess, an undetoxified amount of serotonin in the bloodstream, it can get into the brain and shift the balance away from dopamine.

**Andrew Murray:** You've always said that the bulk of the serotonin produced is produced in the bowel, correct?

**Dr. Peat:** 95% of it, yeah.

**Sarah Murray:** And it's produced—serotonin. We're thought is we've been told for the last 30 years that serotonin is the feel-good hormone and it's good for you. But you view—well, scientists view—serotonin as a major inflammatory compound. And actually the antidepressants that are supposed to be increasing serotonin, they've now retracted that statement. And scientists are now saying that serotonin is not blocked by these antidepressants like SSRIs. So how did that go wrong there? And why is serotonin so inflammatory?

**Dr. Peat:** Its natural function in the bowel is to cause contractions and secretion when the bowel is irritated. Irritation can be mechanical or chemical or biological, but the intestine knows it wants to get rid of something toxic and harmful, so it produces serotonin that causes intense contractions and secretions and should wash the toxin out of the bowel. But if you get a chronic inflammation and irritation, you just get a chronic moderate excess of serotonin that can cause usually just periodic cyclic diarrhea alternating with constipation.

**Sarah Murray:** So everyone who's had car sickness can relate to the feeling of high serotonin, where your intestines are cramping and you feel nauseous. That's all from serotonin, correct?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. And one of the effects of serotonin is anxiety—that's now being more and more recognized rather than sleep-inducing. It can cause insomnia and anxiety. And the bowel has a big role in that.

## FODMAP, Milk, and Treatment Approaches

tags: [[fodmap]] [[milk-intolerance]] [[cascara]] [[probiotics]] [[treatment]]

**Andrew Murray:** Can I just start with the FODMAP kind of criteria that the medical industry use as guidance? And then ask you a little bit about the breath testing results that seem to be somewhat disparaging—they're not completely conclusive by any means—but in conjunction with symptoms can lead to a diagnosis. In terms of the foods that they talk about that are predisposing to these fermentable oligosaccharides and disaccharides, what's your view?

**Dr. Peat:** I think avoidance of many of them is very reasonable. They recommend against beans and lentils, for example, and nuts and wheat and rye. All of those things have other harmful effects as well as the fermentable carbohydrates.

**Andrew Murray:** Less milk. I mean, that's the thing. And as one thing about—it's not all dairy because they say that even butter and cheese is very low in FODMAP equivalents and that cow's milk essentially, and custard and things that are made from milk are quoted as high. And I work with a lot of people who want to—they are fairly sure that they are lactose intolerant. And obviously a large mainstay of your nutritional advice, which is very supportive and produces a balanced diet in terms of vitamins and nutrients from a fairly select source of foods—milk is one of those food groups of which you're a big advocate of drinking milk. And then how do you feel about people that come to you with a quote, unquote, milk intolerance? Because most published papers seem to suggest that most people can actually drink a reasonable amount of milk. And it's not until they are drinking a large amount of milk that the FODMAP components of the milk are a problem.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, I think there's a kind of cultish fear of milk that gets mixed up with the research. And even lactose-intolerant people can tolerate a moderate amount, especially if they start with a small amount.

**Sarah Murray:** Right, Dr. Pete. If they start with a small amount every day and increase it, then they will start developing over the period of two to four weeks lactase, which is the enzyme required to digest lactose. But if they haven't been drinking milk, your body won't make enough lactase to digest a glass all of a sudden.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. There were studies done in ethnic Chinese people in California introducing milk to people who thought they were lactose intolerant. And in a few weeks, taking maybe half a glass at a time, they were able to induce the enzymes. There's probably nothing in the body that isn't inducible, given the appropriate circumstances. Babies need to process the milk diet. And if they totally go without milk, then it's natural that they would adapt away the digestive enzymes relevant to milk. But the experiments show that so far everyone can induce again the lactase enzymes.

**Andrew Murray:** So for somebody with, for example, people that will disclose that they notice a definite change in bowel habits when they are drinking milk and seem to imply that the milk is tending in them to produce kind of pellet stools—that type, I mean, that's not the type of constipation that we are talking about associated with SIBO constipation. But what do you think is happening in that instance in terms of their bowel bacteria? You think it's the bowel bacteria that are responsible? Changes in the stool itself or is there any other mechanism by which the proteins in the milk may be affecting them?

**Dr. Peat:** There are several possibilities, including the pasture, the foods that the cow gets. Sometimes they are very allergenic. And the person with allergies to those plants—if the cow is eating them, the milk will trigger those allergies.

**Sarah Murray:** Especially like if someone's very gluten sensitive and the cow's fed wheat, then it can come through the milk and make a person react poorly to that milk.

**Dr. Peat:** Right. Same with breast milk. If the mother is eating a lot of allergenic foods—peanuts, for example—the baby will often get constipated.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, so looking at possible diagnostic techniques for people that would be interested in taking this conversation further, if those people who are listening perhaps have really had a bout of fairly chronic GI disturbance leading to either chronic diarrhea and/or chronic constipation with little changing it—in terms of anything they've never tried—checking their body temperature is a good first step.

**Dr. Peat:** Their body temperature is a good first step, because hypometabolism—usually because of thyroid deficiency, sometimes from other nutrient deficiencies—but the hypometabolism lowers your body temperature and at the same time makes your tissues over-sensitive to irritation. So just by increasing your body temperature, getting enough easily absorbed glucose and fructose from sucrose, for example, the heat-producing effect of those carbohydrates can be enough to raise your body temperature, reduce the inflammation, and make your intestine go more smoothly.

**Andrew Murray:** All the papers that I've read on SIBO from 2003 until 2021 that have been done very recently seem to agree on a microbiome that has been deranged. They look at two particular species of bacteria: the Proteobacteria and the Firmicutes—like Escherichia, Klebsiella, Aeromonas species of bacteria—saying that in patients with SIBO there's a relative decrease in the Firmicutes bacteria with an increase in the Proteobacteria, and the converse in non-SIBO patients. Would you be looking at anything other than an antibiotic, which is what they now are coming up with? And that's why I mentioned Cascara and probiotics. And what do you think about their use in gastrointestinal disorders like SIBO or IBS?

**Dr. Peat:** Cascara accelerates the movement through the intestine as well as reducing inflammation and maintaining oxidative energy production. But completely indigestible fiber, specifically cellulose, the bulk effect can stimulate peristalsis and speed the movement through the intestine, reducing the chance for toxic fermentation. And making sure that your nutrients—calcium and vitamin D—are anti-inflammatory necessities. Thyroid is anti-inflammatory, and the flavonoids. One of the reasons I recommend orange juice and milk is that they are both good sources of flavonoids without any of the toxic irritants that you find in some of the flavonoid-rich foods, leaves, and some green vegetables that are rich in flavonoids also contain irritants. But orange juice is a very wide spectrum anti-inflammatory and energy-producing food.

**Sarah Murray:** So I think the whole premise about eating foods that don't feed bacteria, like avoiding refined processed grains and starches, is that then you'll have a reduction in bacteria in your small intestine as well as your large intestine. And that's why you also recommend antibacterial foods like grated raw carrot, bamboo shoots, well-cooked mushrooms, oat bran in some instances to help increase the transit time as well as to act as a natural gentle antimicrobial in both places. Because there'll be antimicrobial in the small intestine as well as the large intestine, correct?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. And aspirin sometimes is a big help to decrease the bacterial activity.

## Caller on Diet and Pau d'Arco

tags: [[pau-d-arco]] [[diet-composition]] [[stevia]] [[protein]]

**Caller:** Yes sir, I'm calling from Redwood, California. I eat primarily 70% vegetables, 20% dairy—cheese, yogurt. I also make a homemade flax soda bread. And then the other 10% is like salad dressings. This is like my summertime eating method. And I use a sweetener that is stevia. And when I usually finish off the meal, there's usually a tiny trace of some sort of sweetener like sugar or some other sweetener, honey. So I finish off the meal with Pau d'Arco.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, well everyone has different ideas about good nutrition, but 70% vegetable—I know Dr. Pete, you would definitely recommend well-cooking those—and 20% dairy. I'm not too sure what you think about that—high or low. And obviously from a herbal point of view, Pau d'Arco has been well known as an anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer. And in fact last month's radio show we mentioned Pau d'Arco and those dark red pigments that come from either an ethanol extraction or even simply decocting the herb and how they have an electronic activity that is a very anti-inflammatory activity in substances like lapachol and others that have been isolated. But Dr. Pete, as a mainstay nutritional breakdown—certainly vegetables, 20% dairy, soda bread, and very very little sugars in the form of stevia.

**Dr. Peat:** I'm not sure that stevia is safe in large quantities, but a small amount is probably okay. And soda bread—does that mean that it's a baking powder quick-rising that tends to leave most of the gluten intact? But if it agrees with your intestine and doesn't cause inflammation, then that means your bowel health is pretty good. And cooked, very well-cooked vegetables are fine if a person doesn't have any problem with them.

**Sarah Murray:** The one thing I would think with an analysis of that is the protein. I'm not sure where your protein is coming from besides the dairy. Do you include eggs in your diet or any type of shellfish or other nutrient-rich proteins?

**Caller:** I eat a lot of eggs.

**Sarah Murray:** Okay. I don't know if that was included in the 20% dairy.

**Caller:** Well that was included in the other 30%—like the salad dressings, the miscellaneous cheese, et cetera.

**Andrew Murray:** Well thanks for your call and hope you have a good night.

## Antibiotics, Probiotics, and the mRNA Platform

tags: [[antibiotics]] [[probiotics]] [[sibo-treatment]] [[mrna]] [[transhumanism]]

**Andrew Murray:** To just wrap up on the SIBO diagnosis and further treatment—before we get into the other subject here that I think we'll begin with, but then we'll wrap up and talk more extensively on next month in terms of transhumanism and the coming change in corporate structures of treating us as people with medicines that are questionable—what do you think about the use of antibiotics? Obviously there's one particular antibiotic used which is getting pretty good success in treating SIBO by deranging bowel bacteria. Do you think the probiotics that are labeled probiotics—we have typical species that would normally reside in the bowel—as being positive in terms of recolonizing and safely changing the flora? Because it really is a balancing act—you don't want any unwanted bacteria to take out permanent residence. That's exactly how SIBO starts in the first place. What do you think of antibiotics and recolonization?

**Dr. Peat:** There are several bacteria in particular, some fungus that produce antibiotics themselves. And so they are a combination of probiotic and antibiotic. They kill off a lot of harmful bacteria by antibiotics that they are producing. But you can usually tell within a few hours if an antibiotic supplement is going to help your digestive symptoms. I think there's too much rigmarole in the diagnosis of digestive problems. A lot of people have forgotten or never realized that tapping your abdomen in different places, you can identify whether you have a fluid accumulation or just gas. You can identify a pocket of gas. Sometimes it's where you wouldn't expect it to be—it should be just in the colon area. But if you're getting gas throughout your small intestine, that will make your whole belly resound like a watermelon.

**Andrew Murray:** Just to confirm this, most people don't think that gas production—obviously, apart from its social disagreement—is a problem, but you should not produce gas, period. Right? I mean, there's nothing good about it.

**Dr. Peat:** No. And in fact, too much methane has those stasis-producing effects leading to constipation. And the diagnosis: if you find methane in your breath or coming out of your skin and so on, it doesn't prove that you have methane-producing bacteria. Because our own mitochondria, when they're under stress—like in the presence of drinking too much alcohol—our own mitochondria produce considerable amounts of methane. So any stress can lead to methane appearing in all of our secretions.

**Sarah Murray:** So when you mentioned different fungi that can act as a probiotic and an antibiotic, are you referring to species like Saccharomyces boulardii or are you thinking of other species?

**Dr. Peat:** No, that's the only one I know of.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, so what do you think about garlic and allicin extract-rich garlic? Because in England there's a company that's been producing this for some time now and got a lot of fanfare about it in terms of correcting intestinal dysbiosis. Obviously it's got a very strong sulfur moiety attached to it, which is created some of its activity. But I think I'm right in thinking that you believe that a lot of people are fairly reactive to garlic in terms of its irritating effects and not just its social effects. But what do you think about the compound allicin and garlic in general—the sulfhydryl compounds?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, those hot compounds can be harmful to your stomach and intestine if you eat large amounts of them. They do kill bacteria, but they also can kill your digestive system epithelial cells.

**Sarah Murray:** I think the highest rate of stomach cancer in the world is Bhutan. My friend visited Bhutan and their diet consists of a lot of chili peppers and they have the highest rate of stomach cancer.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, Central America has a lot of stomach cancer associated with that as well.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, well, I just wanted to bring out the other compounds that would be useful in terms of its antibacterial effect. And certainly the papers written suggest that Berberis bulgaris, containing the ethyloid berberine, is very useful in the treatment of SIBO. And to some extent Hydrastis goldenseal containing berberine also is used. But berberine hydrochloride, I think, is the main component.

So let's just open up the topic for those who are listening and have listened to the previous nine to ten months or so that we've been discussing COVID-19 and all of the nefarious activity both in the origin of it and the COVID narrative and then the COVID push for simple, safe, and effective treatment of it—rather than any biological agent, which is called the vaccine, but which defies any of the parameters of a vaccine's definition. The coming transhumanism. I've heard people like Alex Jones in the past, a long time ago, when I used to listen to him, talk about transhumanism 10, 15 years ago. And here we are, and we see people like Elon Musk rising to these kinds of heights through his industries, becoming a figure of public importance—obviously cautioning us about artificial intelligence certainly—but things like implantable chips that you put in your brain. He's talking about neurobiology and wiring people's brains to these implantable chips that will give them, quote, unquote, superhuman power.

And that part and parcel of the COVID-19 debate lies in the technology used to produce this experimental drug, which they call the vaccine—the mRNA vaccine. But your thoughts on the changes that society is going through. And it's undoubtable that we cannot ignore or deny that society has gone through probably one of the greatest upheavals, psychologically and socially, than has happened really since probably the Second World War. But it's been a long time since such a great upheaval happened.

And now we're being told that the platform, the mRNA platform, upon which this experimental drug has been cheaply, easily, and quickly scaled up to such numbers that they can distribute it worldwide—the collaboration with two other countries, Italy and Switzerland, I think—but the manufacture of these mRNA vaccines, I won't call them vaccines, these mRNA experimental drugs is going to increase to any and every disease that you can think of. And yet the whole platform, the mRNA platform, is quote, unquote, giving us over to genetic changes that are essentially going to put us at risk as a species moving forward. And it's not going to stop.

**Dr. Peat:** I've been for several months looking for what the actual scientific rationale might be for shifting from traditional vaccines—killed or inactivated bacteria or viruses, for example—what the reason was for this sudden shift of all of the vaccine companies towards a nucleic acid.

**Andrew Murray:** They want to say time, don't they? What they want to argue is that the time to produce it is why they've done it, because it's so quick to do it this way. I mean, isn't that the argument?

**Dr. Peat:** I don't think there has been any clear scientific explanation for why they did it. You can shortcut all of the traditional methods of making vaccines. What they did was skip ordinary animal and safety testing to speed it up. But when you look at the individuals behind these companies, you see that years ago they were talking about genetic engineering. And then in justifying why they have come up with the RNA vaccines, they are describing them as changing our genetic operating system—treating us like a computer and simply improving our operating system. Changing the genome is in the context of all of these people justifying why they would use nucleic acids instead of traditional activators of the immune system.

**Sarah Murray:** So we are becoming the genetically modified organism. We might vote to block the production of genetically modified organisms in enhanced food. But now we are becoming the genetically modified organism.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. And when Tony Fauci heard the suggestions of the evidence that the RNA can be copied back—reverse transcribed—into our DNA, he said, that doesn't happen. It can't happen. And so on. He indicated either total ignorance of 50 years of nucleic acid research showing that we do. Everyone contains reverse transcriptase, which, whenever RNA enters a cell—a foreign type of it—it's able to be transcribed into DNA, and the DNA can—it doesn't have to enter the nucleus even. It can be a perpetual part of the cell, an inherited part of the cell, even though it was transcribed from a foreign added RNA or other nucleic acid.

**Sarah Murray:** So they might try to tell you that it's not permanent and your body will stop producing it. But what you're saying is 50 years of research has shown that these changes can very easily become permanent.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. And there have been demonstrations that our exosome system—which is designed to create these little particles like viruses, to communicate proteins and genetic information from one cell to other cells that aren't differentiated properly—an internal regulatory system of our own genes—has been demonstrated to be open to receiving foreign DNA and RNA and packaging it in exosomes so that we participate. Our own mechanism becomes like a virus factory, copying and spreading the foreign DNA and RNA.

**Andrew Murray:** This is exactly what Tal Zaks, the former CEO of Moderna, was quoted as saying—that same thing—in 2017 when he was interviewed. There's an article online that is basically a transcript of the interview mentioning that this platform, the mRNA platform, can be so rapidly scaled up, it's so cheap, it's so quick. And he was questioned about the whole thing about integrating DNA from RNA into us and actually changing us genomically and having hereditary consequences. And he said the same thing as you've said—that Fauci has said—that it's not possible, it doesn't happen, don't worry about it.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. He's actually an oncologist. He was proposing genetic engineering as cancer treatment. And years ago, I think Biden was the instigator or the figurehead for the idea—the cancer moonshot, they called it—which was based on basically genetic engineering on an individual basis to change the genes of your cancer.

**Andrew Murray:** So the other thing that I kind of thought about: we've mentioned this since March—since we just started doing the Ask Your Doctor shows based around COVID—just showing all the time that the mortality was actually very low and that there was definitely optional treatments like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin from the very beginning. And the whistleblower doctors who said that these things were effective—and then, you know, they carried on talking about these same treatments, which are very inexpensive, very safe, and very effective—we don't need this experimental drug. This leads me on to think about the whole Codex Alimentarius and the World Economic Forum being a platform upon which governments will—well, not will, probably are—superseding citizens of countries in tandem, in concert with other governments. And it is certainly not a conspiracy theory, folks. It's a reality. And there's plenty of evidence to show and support that. We're not spouting scary stories here—it's just factual evidence.

I think as you mentioned, Dr. Pete, probably in the next two to five years we'll get borne out with any increased deaths that would come about from either exposure to other regular flus as a result of the enhanced activity of the immune system through this experimental drug. But basically to life in general and our lifestyles being forced into a certain direction. And this is the humanism part of what I want to get into with you next month in more detail and just lay it out for people, because the shows are listened to and certainly the audio archives are listened to and the Internet is full of these interviews that we've done with you on YouTube and other areas. So it's not like it's going to go away. It's been laid down for right now and people will hear it through. As time goes on, the truth will come out a little bit like some of the atrocities of the Second World War and other instances where this activity was shouted about, but no one listened. But afterwards it all came out and they had to agree that what was being shouted was actually the truth. So thank you so much for joining us, Dr. Pete.

**Dr. Peat:** Okay, thank you.

## Closing

**Andrew Murray:** It's three minutes to the hour, so rather than anything else carrying on, I'd rather give people your information and point them to where they can find out more about you and thank you so much for your time on the show tonight.

For people who listen to the show this evening, more can be found out about Dr. Pete and his 40, 50 years of work here on Earth. His website is www.raypeat.com—r a y p e a t dot com—and you can find out lots of reference articles that he's written. He's been working in this field of alternative science to the narrative for 30 years and more, working with people, counseling, et cetera. And we've certainly enjoyed our time with him. He's been very eye-opening in lots of things that we thought were true but have been educated beyond that. And now seeing that we are not the conspiracists, but actually the people with some of the more important information.

Our website is westernbotanicalmedicine.com and until the third Friday of next month, July, we will be picking up on this transhumanism subject and looking at particularly the science that's pushing us forward in this direction. I'm not saying we will want to go in it, but I think unfortunately it's going to be taking people forward whether they like it or not. So until this same time next month, the third Friday next month.

**Sarah Murray:** Good night.
