## Introduction & Welcome
tags: [[intro]] [[welcome]] [[show-overview]] [[june-2022]]

**Andrew Murray:** Good evening and welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor. This is 06/17/2022. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** So welcome to the show. As always, I have the great pleasure of having Doctor Pete's superb overview of a lot of things. Part of his age enables him to encompass at least 40, 50 years of time spent studying the subjects, plus another three decades of living to see the events unfold. He's got a pretty good rounded view of many different subjects, and obviously alternative medicine is one of them. He's spent a large part of his life and career looking at the research, which is always the most interesting part of any factual information. It's not just opinion.

So very pleased to have Doctor Raymond Peat join us on the show. Doctor Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Well, I'll run an introduction to some of the questions I'll be asking you. But first, I wanted to wrap up last month's discourse. We talked about genetic modification and corporations with patent rights on intellectual property—especially Monsanto with their genetically engineered seeds and the so-called moratorium that was put aside. Naturally occurring products like corn, wheat, and potatoes, although they're natural, have now been granted patent rights on their genetically modified versions.

I think this also runs into technology and the emerging infections we've gone through since the mid-1990s until now, with COVID being the major part of our prior two-year discourse. I also wanted to remind people that the lawyer Reiner Furmic has a huge amount of data on the website—I'd encourage everyone to look at it. It's a superb chronologically documented series of allegations, essentially charging crimes against humanity for many organizations, institutions, and governments. That website is https://radical.org/pandemic-parallax-view. It lists every detail about the Wuhan lab, Fauci, the funding, and why people have been hoodwinked.

Also mentioned last month: the United Nations changed the terminology from technocracy to "green economy" and "sustainable development," and how that impacts us negatively because it sounds so innocuous. "Sustainable development"—who doesn't want sustainability? I do. I want local markets, people growing food locally. I don't want huge corporations shipping food worldwide and displacing rural farmers. We want sustainable development, but the words have been couched to embrace this technocracy, which really began around the 1920s. Doctor Pete certainly weighed in on what he understands of technocracy, having lived through it. The Rockefeller Foundation and other power players form the heads of government institutions and global organizations, from Codex Alimentarius to programs exposing this as part of a world government order, leading to the Great Reset we've heard about recently.

## Insurance Mortality Data & Working-Age Deaths
tags: [[mortality-data]] [[insurance-companies]] [[working-age-deaths]] [[covid-vaccine]]

Anyway, that was an overview of last month. I want to open this month with something that caught my eye. The fifth largest life insurance company in the U.S. has paid out 163% more for deaths of working people—not elderly people, but working people from 18 to 64. This group received 163% more in death payouts. The company cites non-pandemic related morbidity and unusual claims adjustments as the explanation. The stock is falling, the CEO has been replaced.

The head of Indianapolis-based One America Insurance said the death rate is up a stunning 40% from pre-pandemic levels among working-age people. Five months after breaking this story, a new report came out: Lincoln National, a much larger life insurance company, reported 163% increase in death benefits paid under its group life insurance policies in 2021. The CEO of One America, Scott Davidson, stated: "We are seeing right now the highest death rates we've seen in the history of this business—not just at One America. The data is consistent across every player in the business."

One America is a $100 billion insurance company with headquarters in Indianapolis since 1877. The company has approximately 2,400 employees and sells group life insurance to employers in the state. Davidson said the increase in deaths represents huge, huge numbers, and it's not elderly people dying, but primarily working-age people—18 through 64—employees of companies with group life insurance through One America.

"What we saw in the third quarter, we're seeing continue into the fourth quarter," he said. "Death rates are up 40% over what they were pre-pandemic." To give you an idea of how bad that is: a three sigma, or one in a two-hundred-year catastrophe, would be a 10% increase over pre-pandemic. So 40% is just unheard of.

It was not only deaths of working-age people that shot up to unheard-of levels in 2021, but also short and long-term disability claims. If this holds true, the genetic vaccines so aggressively promoted have failed. The clear federal campaign to prevent early treatment with life-saving drugs has contributed to massive avoidable loss of life.

At worst, this implies that federal workplace vaccine mandates have driven what appears to be a crime against humanity—massive loss of life in workers forced to accept a toxic vaccine at higher frequency relative to the general population of Indiana. Furthermore, we've been living through the most massive globally coordinated propaganda and censorship campaign in the history of the human race. All major mass media and social media technology companies have coordinated to stifle and suppress any discussion of the risks of genetic vaccines and alternative early treatments. Between artificial intelligence-powered algorithms and social media tech giants complicit in suppression of information, we've witnessed an avoidable mass casualty event, needlessly caused by a mandated experimental medical procedure.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several other companies since then have reported very similar increased mortality around 40% in the working-age group. Insurance companies generally have extremely accurate statistics—better than governments as a rule—because their income depends on exactness. So it's really the scientific basis for saying it wasn't the virus that's responsible, but the vaccination. That's when the 40% rise began. It fits what skeptical virologists have been claiming: that mortality is going to be far, far worse from the vaccine than from whatever occurred from the virus.

**Andrew Murray:** Bruce, I think the point was that it was all-cause mortality in young people, and a lot of it was related to damage and disability. So whether the deaths were caused by the vaccine or not, the amount of money paid out due to claimed disabilities is pretty stunning. I think we've mentioned that insurance companies let this information out, which supported claims about mortality and altitude—lower premiums were imposed on people at higher altitude because they really were not as likely as people at sea level to die.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay. So that's the first thing—glaring headlines about deaths and insurance companies making payouts, now just part of the fallout of COVID and everything that happened trying to mitigate this virus. That's been a fairly long process for the last two years.

## Omicron Variant: Gene Sequences & Origin
tags: [[omicron]] [[virus-mutations]] [[lab-origin]] [[gene-sequences]]

Supposedly what we're seeing now with Omicron—whether your opinion is that Omicron is a naturally produced variant or indeed any other type...

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has the most bizarre gene sequences of all the other variants. Starting with the Wuhan variant, the other variants show a series of mutations building on each other. The most recent variant before Omicron showed exactly the same series of mutations incorporated—so it was definitely that virus improving its survivability by mutating. But Omicron is unique. It didn't show any mutations after Wuhan. While the Wuhan virus was going through all these changes, nothing was happening to Omicron. Suddenly when it pops up, it is essentially the pristine Wuhan virus with a new series built right on the original virus. None of the history of natural mutation, as if it wasn't in the world at all for these intervening years.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So are you saying the original COVID went through mutations you can track, and then all of a sudden Omicron was like the original with just some alterations? So it looked like it had been lab-produced?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And those mutations made it much less harmful. So if someone were preparing a product to end the pandemic by turning it off with a fairly harmless virus...

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if people have Omicron and they've developed antibodies to it naturally—even though it's not naturally mutated—will they be better able to fight the original Delta or those other variants?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it won't especially affect them. If it's the dominant virus and it's very harmless, then the other one just isn't going to be around to cause trouble.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay. So moving on to the major content of this next forty-five minutes, I read an article about the Oakland Institute from 2014. Nearly eight years later, we're seeing what's happening in Ukraine and Russia. It's not just a political question, but really about health, government control and takeovers, and aggressive campaigning. We've all heard about Roundup and Monsanto—it's a huge corporation.

## Ukraine, Monsanto & Agricultural Control
tags: [[ukraine]] [[monsanto]] [[agriculture]] [[geopolitics]] [[imf]]

The Oakland Institute published a 2014 paper outlining what was described as a global corporate takeover of agricultural land in Ukraine. Ukraine has been hailed as the breadbasket of Europe, with a staggering 32 million plus hectares of incredibly fertile black arable soil. For gardeners, horticulturalists, or farmers, this means lush, rich, fertile growth with excellent crop yields and quality harvests. If you're Monsanto, one of the biggest agribusinesses on the planet, or one of a handful of other players buying into this hugely profitable location, the rights to ownership are extremely lucrative. Corruption, as always, exists at the highest level for the highest returns.

Ukraine's agricultural land was under a moratorium that banned its sale through 01/01/2016. When Ukraine separated from the Soviet Union in 1990, collectivized communal farms were disbanded, and land was distributed in parcels of approximately four hectares each to people living on those collectivized farms. In 02/2001, Ukraine passed its land code legislation that gave people functional titles to land. Since then, there's been a moratorium on the sale of land, extended through 01/01/2016. The moratorium applies only to agricultural land, making it both legal and affordable for investors to build and operate a 100% foreign-owned processing facility while leasing fields from agricultural landowners until the moratorium was lifted.

A second way investors could circumvent the land moratorium was by buying shares of large existing Ukrainian agribusinesses. The system of land distribution in the 1990s often led to concentration of land in the hands of a few elites. Alongside land, opportunities in Ukraine for development, production and use of agricultural inputs like seeds, agrochemicals and fertilizers have attracted investment by agribusiness giants: Monsanto, Cargill, DuPont and others.

**Andrew Murray:** So I was going to ask you, Doctor Pete, you had lots of other information to tie this together.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everyone has heard about the International Monetary Fund offering Ukraine a $40 billion loan if they would stop the moratorium—specifically so Monsanto and the other giant corporations could concentrate ownership on a big corporate scale. There was a coup to make that happen because the elected president had rejected the IMF fund. The IMF, working with the World Bank and all the other so-called Western authorities, wanted to reverse that, stop the moratorium, so they supported the coup. The coup was very clear they were going to adapt laws that would let Monsanto take over. When the coup happened, that did take place. So they had to get rid of the legally elected president and establish the Zelensky government supporting the Monsanto privatization system.

Well, part of the Monsanto thing is that they want to use chemicals like Roundup to make the profitability of certain giant land corporations favorable to them. The European Union had opposed the United States policy of supporting Monsanto and genetic modification. So there was a conflict between Western Europe, who had quite a lot of resistance. Several Western European countries went along with wanting to outlaw GMOs. That was creating stresses between Western Europe and anti-GMO people.

It turned out that historically Russia had been passing laws to promote organic farming and to outlaw GMOs. So they were aiming for 100% freedom from GMOs and naturally from Monsanto. That really was the polarization for the coup, for the International Monetary Fund loan. When the elected president made a deal with Russia for a loan that would bypass the IMF, that was the actual moment when the coup took place and they cut him out of Ukraine.

**Andrew Murray:** I read a couple of years ago that Vladimir Putin was boasting he was gonna make Russia one of the, if not the biggest, organic food producer in the world. Yeah, that's one of his goals. But I thought GMOs are still banned in Europe. Well, I think they are in England. I'm pretty sure England has banned GMOs. Is that what you're understanding, Doctor Pete?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are wobbling on the issue. There is still opposition to it, but now the war for Monsanto has affected the West, and they aren't pushing so hard to oppose GMOs.

## Fertilizer Shortage & Supply Chain Control
tags: [[fertilizer]] [[supply-chain]] [[union-pacific]] [[black-rock]] [[food-economy]]

**Andrew Murray:** I wonder how the whole fertilizer shortage plays into it. Apparently Ukraine is a big exporter or manufacturer of fertilizer. I wonder how that plays into it along with the agricultural diversity possible in Ukraine and how this quote-unquote food shortage they're now talking about connects. Before we get into the subject of baby milk, I wonder how politically motivated this is. In terms of polling?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, you can see many specific things in which it's been just openly promoted. For example, Union Pacific Railroad announced that they just weren't going to ship all of the fertilizer that the farmers needed. That preceded by several weeks the announcement that they were not going to allow the shipment and sale of urea, which is used in the diesel motors of trucks. By restricting the availability of this urea fuel modifier, they can turn off truck delivery. But as a railroad, they said they're not gonna ship all of the fertilizer that's ordered.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And why did they say that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No one knows, but it seems they are controlled by Black Rock, the giant funds. And that is also just openly intending to turn off the food economy.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So they want to create a shortage for some monetary gain?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. If you look at the pattern over the last several years, just weeks before the pandemic, Cloud Swab was saying, "Well, we've done our best to use carbon dioxide and climate change, mistaken science, to fulfill our purpose of controlling overall production. But now luckily, we've got something much, much better that in just a period of two or three years, we'll be able to turn off the national and world production of everything—the ordinary daily economy, including food and all of the necessary supply."

## Censorship, Information Control & Free Speech
tags: [[censorship]] [[information-control]] [[free-speech]] [[propaganda]]

**Andrew Murray:** I mean, you can't make this stuff up. This reminds me of the whole discourse I first heard with Rima Labo back in 02/2006, I think it was, about Codex Alimentarius. The entire thing is essentially a playbook from the end of the war or just before, really, with the emergence of technocracy through to global governments and one world currency. It's all been documented. The way she was talking back in 02/2006, it blew me away. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I just wanted to know: is this totally fantastic fantasy or is this real? And the more you look at it, the more connections you see.

When we get things like the war in Ukraine and hear that Russia is deciding on the side of organic production, and it was part of former Russia, what really is the problem? Obviously there's a problem with people dying. Don't get me wrong—I don't condone any war. But the reasons by which this happened are serious government evil, prospects and control and manipulation of the populations of various countries to produce the narrative they want. That's exactly what social media has sought to bring about since it all came out for Facebook and YouTube and all of the glorious technology of social media. Back in 2009 or so, when iPhones were becoming really popular and the software to do this was connecting all these people like never before.

It might sound a little scary to people just listening, but there's a lot more in it. Unfortunately, I don't think there's a huge amount we can do about it except peacefully protest. I think that's the saddest part of what I've witnessed going through these last two years. There's such polarization, such control of information that people are not getting the full information. I just heard today that Simone Gold, one of the doctors in LA with the American Frontline Doctors, who was organizing patient consultations and alternatives to COVID treatments that were experimental drugs, she's just been in prison for two months. This was all part and parcel of her 2020 appearance at the State Capitol and her peaceful protest, basically saying she objected to what was going on.

The whole thing about free speech is: if we're not careful folks, it's gone. Getting ratted out by your neighbor and Soviet-style era of people watching people and policing each other—it's kind of a scary reality which I think has crept in so pervasively with this COVID quote-unquote pandemic. Most people are looking, I'm not quite sure where they're getting their information from that counters this narrative we hear about everywhere. I mean, to find an alternative view on the COVID scenario is kind of the exception.

## Baby Formula Crisis: Dangers of Soy & PUFA
tags: [[baby-formula]] [[soy-formula]] [[pufa]] [[dehydrated-milk]] [[nutrition]]

Getting to the milk crisis—the baby milk crisis. I wonder what your opinion is because I know you've definitely got lots to say about soy and PUFA and all of these things. From a perspective of making money from a corporate perspective, from the perspective of mothers in Africa—and I'm not saying that women who have children that don't produce enough milk shouldn't be helped, of course not. But there are other alternatives to formula. What do you think about this baby formula crisis? It may be not a bad thing.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The soy formula had its own terrible side effects in immature animals. The estrogenic factors associated with the proteins used in making the male substitute cause deformed genitals in the developing young and later promote tumors of various sorts. So the plant-based milk formulas were a terrible problem in themselves.

Nestle's innovation was basically selling dehydrated cow milk as a basis for people around the world to mix up at home to produce a liquid milk substitute, despite the fact that clean water to mix it with is absent in so many of the poor countries. So they were doing something very counter-social and counter-interest.

But even in the US, where people couldn't make a formula themselves if they really couldn't produce milk, they could simply make a formula based on cow milk. When it isn't dehydrated, the reaction on the immune system is less harmful. To take nonhuman milk and introduce it right at the very beginning will cause some antigenic differences, but at least if it's made from fresh cow milk, that's a lot safer than dehydrating because every time you dehydrate a living substance, you kill it and oxidize some of the proteins, amino acids, and especially the fatty acids. The cholesterol is oxidized.

That's really only one of the fairly trivial problems of dehydrated milk. The cholesterol is damaged and made toxic, but many, many other components of the milk are susceptible to oxidative damage. There's a whole anti-science that has grown up to defend the industry's use, not only of dehydrated milk, but of the added polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which is really a separate issue.

They argue that human milk contained more PUFA than cow milk. So that became a separate industry to say that the baby must be given a supplement of omega-3 fatty acids because, they say, almost all babies at birth have evidence of a deficiency of omega-3.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that's because the placenta has filtered it out.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, exactly. It is recognized as something to be excluded during pregnancy. But they reverse that and say you need to supplement everyone because everyone is deficient.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Because the body naturally tries to keep it away from the baby. You're deficient. That rationale is insane.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And they extend that to say that the aged brain contains increased amounts of omega-3 PUFA. So they're wanting to say that because you find it in the old brain, that means it should be there. But meanwhile, the old brain has deteriorated in proportion to the reduction of mitochondrial energy production, and that reduction corresponds to the increased presence of omega-3 PUFA in the brain. So at every point, they've twisted the science. One of the ways they twist it is with a certain test of retinal responsiveness to electrical stimulation. They say if you increase that with your added PUFA, you're going to show that addition makes the eye develop faster and the brain develop its mental ability sooner.

## Caller: Menopause Support & Natural Remedies
tags: [[menopause]] [[brain-fog]] [[nausea]] [[herbal-medicine]]

A caller came in off the air asking about remedies for menopause symptoms—she was experiencing brain fog and nausea.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Ginger is always great for nausea.

**Andrew Murray:** For brain fog, we're looking for good nootropics. I don't know how supportive you are of nootropics outside of using anti-stress substances like pregnenolone for decreasing cortisol and inflammation. What would your response be?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh yeah. All of those things—coffee, for example, aspirin—things that promote mitochondrial oxidative use. Sugar and herbal support would be Vitex, Chaste Tree Berry, and Black Cohosh. Those are very effective at helping mitigate menopausal symptoms.

## Fresh Milk vs Synthetic Breast Milk
tags: [[breast-milk]] [[cow-milk]] [[formula]] [[nutrition]]

Sarah asked a follow-up question about making formula from fresh milk. The question: if all baby formula is dehydrated, would you suggest adding anything to cow milk, fresh cow milk?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. You can adjust the amount of fat and water if it makes it more palatable to the baby. But just as is, it'll work.

Sarah then asked: what about the talk in the news of synthetic breast milk? Do you think that would be preferable to cow's milk for babies?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, assuming that the mother is eating properly, because human milk reflects the human diet because we don't have a rumen. The cow can eat grass and weeds and quite a lot of polyunsaturated fats and detoxifies them in the rumen. So as a rule, if the woman is eating well, then her milk is gonna be better than cow's milk.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Of course, mama's milk, breast milk is preferable for a baby, with a healthy diet. But I've read about making breast milk in a laboratory, trying to synthesize breast milk in a lab. What are your thoughts on that?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Well, probably not good. It might have certain similarities to breast milk, but it's definitely going to be a synthetic material.

## Artificial Meat & Separation from the Natural World
tags: [[artificial-meat]] [[natural-foods]] [[protein-aging]] [[metabolic-rate]]

**Andrew Murray:** What about the subject of artificial meat? Between milk and meat and canceling out substances like sugar, I think the industry is seeking to separate people from their natural world. I'm not saying everyone needs to drink milk, but milk is an extremely good food. There's so much evidence to support its use that the whole demonization of it is the same kind of skewing information you've given previous examples of.

You've mentioned that protein intake for older people doesn't necessarily need to be decreased. You're not big on muscle meat per se—you've always encouraged people to use the whole animal, getting gelatin from making broth with chicken or knuckle bones or lamb shank.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. For many years people have been aware that with aging, the metabolic rate slows down. Brode Barnes was thinking about that and the importance of metabolic rate. He had been using a supplement of two grains of armored thyroid, and he decided to go on a high protein diet when he was around 60, and found that he had to double his dose of thyroid hormone to maintain his functioning. That shows that for an older person, what seems to be a good level of protein can actually be very powerfully suppressive to your thyroid function.

**Andrew Murray:** We've talked about soy protein in the past being used as a meat alternative. We know that's definitely not beneficial because it raises estrogen in men and women and is relatively inflammatory in its own right.

I think this speaks to a buyer beware mentality that everyone needs to try and remember. It's like social media and technology—we're kind of cajoled and lured into this seemingly fuzzy world of comfortable technology. We're really sucking down so much poison that it's like being on drugs that completely separate you from reality in terms of what's actually going on around you. You don't say anything and you're just cajoled and fuzzily thinking "it's okay if the government knows what they're doing. This COVID vaccine's a good thing. It saves lives."

## Seed Saving, Food Sovereignty & Local Gardens
tags: [[seed-saving]] [[corporate-control]] [[food-sovereignty]] [[local-gardens]]

We had another caller from the Arcadia area who wanted to comment on the general trend of big corporations trying to control everything. The caller talked about seeds. While talking to a vendor at the farmer's market, they learned they had to buy seeds. Looking at the trend of how things are evolving, the caller expected that over time the seed supply is going to be controlled mostly by big companies, and they encouraged people to learn how to make their own seed, grow their own seed, save seed, and try to keep it from being contaminated with genes designed to make seeds sterile and non-reproducing.

**Andrew Murray:** This really applies to people fortunate enough to have a garden—not acres of land, but a small garden to grow vegetables. We've all known this and it's happened in China, quite successfully, where millions and hundreds of millions of people were pulled out of rural agrarian locations and brought to the cities. When you're in the cities under government domain, you don't have a garden and don't have a connection to the natural world—that's when all of this breaks down.

It's very similar to biblical references like the Tower of Babel, where massive confusion prevented people from understanding each other. They wanted to get on without God and didn't feel they needed natural creation. Unfortunately, that's a side effect of our humanism—we're numbed. So many people are just sucking it down. I find it hard to believe they're pulling it off, but I think what's happening is a concerted and orchestrated attempt. We're not even resisting—it's an orchestrated play and we're just going through the motions. But I'd never give up. I'd encourage everybody listening: never give up. They're never going to win. You just have to keep resisting until the very end because the end is not the end.

## Hope, Cosmic Redemption & Resistance
tags: [[hope]] [[resistance]] [[cosmic-justice]] [[world-economic-order]]

**Andrew Murray:** Doctor Peat, you've been around quite a while now and you've seen governments come and go, heads of state come and go, lots of headlines and politics. In these last few closing moments, I want to ask: is there any hope for the world? I mean, I know we're still alive and trying to do the right thing, but where are you with all of this?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm still hopeful. Like Reiner Fyolnir said, we have to do everything legal and possible to try to prosecute these people. But at some point, we have to count on some kind of a cosmic bailout for us.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Wait. Reiner is counting on a cosmic bailout?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I forgot his exact phrase, but he said he couldn't explain it rationally, but he had this confidence that the universe wasn't going to let that turn out the way the World Economic Federation hopes.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Or the IMF.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay. Well, that's hopeful. There's hope then. I appreciate your time joining us on the show. I can only hope that people are listening and not calling in. The archive is there for people to listen to in the future, and the future will vindicate what you've said for a long time.

## Closing Remarks & Show Information
tags: [[closing]] [[technocracy]] [[resistance]] [[war-crimes]]

I just wanted to finish by saying there's an undeniable connection between technocracy and dehumanization through lockdowns and social isolation. Through government coercive measures and Soviet-era style social control—where individuals are set against individuals, similar to the brownshirts of Nazi Germany—we're now in an Orwellian reality that, unless it's resisted, will become the de facto new normal. It must be resisted vehemently through peaceful protests and political involvement on the state and local level.

We need another Hague in charges of international war crimes against humanity where the guilty are charged. That's why Reiner Formik's group in Germany is pressing these charges at this very moment. The thing is ongoing. I like to think that there is real justice and that we're not going to be sucked into the matrix—that we will find a way through it.

## Show Information & Resources
tags: [[show-info]] [[western-botanical-medicine]] [[raypeat]] [[archive]]

For those of you who've listened to the show, Ask the Herb Doctor runs every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 PM on KMUD. We'll be back in July. We're coming up to the solstice now.

We run a business called Western Botanical Medicine. Doctor Raymond Peat's website is raypeat.com. He has plenty of scientific reference articles that are not his opinion, but are pulled from current medical journals, past medical journals, medical research, and trials.

This information may not be something you'll find on your Facebook group or if you just Google it. Up until now, you probably won't find it, and some of it's going to be censored. We're probably moving into a more censored environment as we go on folks. So people just watch out.

Anyway, without being alarmist about it, my name is Andrew Murray and we'll talk to you again in July. My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Thank you for listening.
