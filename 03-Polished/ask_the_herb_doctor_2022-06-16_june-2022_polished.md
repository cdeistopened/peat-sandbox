## Introduction & Welcome
tags: [[intro]] [[welcome]] [[show-overview]] [[june-2022]]

**Andrew Murray:** Good evening and welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor. This is 06/17/2022. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** So welcome to the show. As always, I have the great pleasure of having Doctor Pete's superb overview of a lot of things. Part of his age enables him to encompass at least 40, 50 years of time spent studying the subjects, plus another three decades of living to see the events unfold. He's got a pretty good rounded view of many different subjects, and obviously alternative medicine is one of them. He's spent a large part of his life and career looking at the research, which is always the most interesting part of any factual information. It's not just opinion.

So very pleased to have Doctor Raymond Peat join us on the show. Doctor Peat, are you there?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Well, I'll run an introduction to some of the questions I'll be asking you. But first, I wanted to wrap up last month's discourse. We talked about genetic modification and corporations with patent rights on intellectual property—especially Monsanto with their genetically engineered seeds and the so-called moratorium that was put aside. Naturally occurring products like corn, wheat, and potatoes, although they're natural, have now been granted patent rights on their genetically modified versions.

I think this also runs into technology and the emerging infections we've gone through since the mid-1990s until now, with COVID being the major part of our prior two-year discourse. I also wanted to remind people that the lawyer Reiner Furmic has a huge amount of data on the website—I'd encourage everyone to look at it. It's a superb chronologically documented series of allegations, essentially charging crimes against humanity for many organizations, institutions, and governments. That website is https://radical.org/pandemic-parallax-view. It lists every detail about the Wuhan lab, Fauci, the funding, and why people have been hoodwinked.

Also mentioned last month: the United Nations changed the terminology from technocracy to "green economy" and "sustainable development," and how that impacts us negatively because it sounds so innocuous. "Sustainable development"—who doesn't want sustainability? I do. I want local markets, people growing food locally. I don't want huge corporations shipping food worldwide and displacing rural farmers. We want sustainable development, but the words have been couched to embrace this technocracy, which really began around the 1920s. Doctor Pete certainly weighed in on what he understands of technocracy, having lived through it. The Rockefeller Foundation and other power players form the heads of government institutions and global organizations, from Codex Alimentarius to programs exposing this as part of a world government order, leading to the Great Reset we've heard about recently.

## Insurance Mortality Data & Working-Age Deaths
tags: [[mortality-data]] [[insurance-companies]] [[working-age-deaths]] [[covid-vaccine]]

Anyway, that was an overview of last month. I want to open this month with something that caught my eye. The fifth largest life insurance company in the U.S. has paid out 163% more for deaths of working people—not elderly people, but working people from 18 to 64. This group received 163% more in death payouts. The company cites non-pandemic related morbidity and unusual claims adjustments as the explanation. The stock is falling, the CEO has been replaced.

The head of Indianapolis-based One America Insurance said the death rate is up a stunning 40% from pre-pandemic levels among working-age people. Five months after breaking this story, a new report came out: Lincoln National, a much larger life insurance company, reported 163% increase in death benefits paid under its group life insurance policies in 2021. The CEO of One America, Scott Davidson, stated: "We are seeing right now the highest death rates we've seen in the history of this business—not just at One America. The data is consistent across every player in the business."

One America is a $100 billion insurance company with headquarters in Indianapolis since 1877. The company has approximately 2,400 employees and sells group life insurance to employers in the state. Davidson said the increase in deaths represents huge, huge numbers, and it's not elderly people dying, but primarily working-age people—18 through 64—employees of companies with group life insurance through One America.

"What we saw in the third quarter, we're seeing continue into the fourth quarter," he said. "Death rates are up 40% over what they were pre-pandemic." To give you an idea of how bad that is: a three sigma, or one in a two-hundred-year catastrophe, would be a 10% increase over pre-pandemic. So 40% is just unheard of.

It was not only deaths of working-age people that shot up to unheard-of levels in 2021, but also short and long-term disability claims. If this holds true, the genetic vaccines so aggressively promoted have failed. The clear federal campaign to prevent early treatment with life-saving drugs has contributed to massive avoidable loss of life.

At worst, this implies that federal workplace vaccine mandates have driven what appears to be a crime against humanity—massive loss of life in workers forced to accept a toxic vaccine at higher frequency relative to the general population of Indiana. Furthermore, we've been living through the most massive globally coordinated propaganda and censorship campaign in the history of the human race. All major mass media and social media technology companies have coordinated to stifle and suppress any discussion of the risks of genetic vaccines and alternative early treatments. Between artificial intelligence-powered algorithms and social media tech giants complicit in suppression of information, we've witnessed an avoidable mass casualty event, needlessly caused by a mandated experimental medical procedure.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Several other companies since then have reported very similar increased mortality around 40% in the working-age group. Insurance companies generally have extremely accurate statistics—better than governments as a rule—because their income depends on exactness. So it's really the scientific basis for saying it wasn't the virus that's responsible, but the vaccination. That's when the 40% rise began. It fits what skeptical virologists have been claiming: that mortality is going to be far, far worse from the vaccine than from whatever occurred from the virus.

**Andrew Murray:** Bruce, I think the point was that it was all-cause mortality in young people, and a lot of it was related to damage and disability. So whether the deaths were caused by the vaccine or not, the amount of money paid out due to claimed disabilities is pretty stunning. I think we've mentioned that insurance companies let this information out, which supported claims about mortality and altitude—lower premiums were imposed on people at higher altitude because they really were not as likely as people at sea level to die.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay. So that's the first thing—glaring headlines about deaths and insurance companies making payouts, now just part of the fallout of COVID and everything that happened trying to mitigate this virus. That's been a fairly long process for the last two years.

## Omicron Variant: Gene Sequences & Origin
tags: [[omicron]] [[virus-mutations]] [[lab-origin]] [[gene-sequences]]

Supposedly what we're seeing now with Omicron—whether your opinion is that Omicron is a naturally produced variant or indeed any other type...

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It has the most bizarre gene sequences of all the other variants. Starting with the Wuhan variant, the other variants show a series of mutations building on each other. The most recent variant before Omicron showed exactly the same series of mutations incorporated—so it was definitely that virus improving its survivability by mutating. But Omicron is unique. It didn't show any mutations after Wuhan. While the Wuhan virus was going through all these changes, nothing was happening to Omicron. Suddenly when it pops up, it is essentially the pristine Wuhan virus with a new series built right on the original virus. None of the history of natural mutation, as if it wasn't in the world at all for these intervening years.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So are you saying the original COVID went through mutations you can track, and then all of a sudden Omicron was like the original with just some alterations? So it looked like it had been lab-produced?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And those mutations made it much less harmful. So if someone were preparing a product to end the pandemic by turning it off with a fairly harmless virus...

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So if people have Omicron and they've developed antibodies to it naturally—even though it's not naturally mutated—will they be better able to fight the original Delta or those other variants?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** No, it won't especially affect them. If it's the dominant virus and it's very harmless, then the other one just isn't going to be around to cause trouble.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay. So moving on to the major content of this next forty-five minutes, I read an article about the Oakland Institute from 2014. Nearly eight years later, we're seeing what's happening in Ukraine and Russia. It's not just a political question, but really about health, government control and takeovers, and aggressive campaigning. We've all heard about Roundup and Monsanto—it's a huge corporation.

## Ukraine, Monsanto & Agricultural Control
tags: [[ukraine]] [[monsanto]] [[agriculture]] [[geopolitics]] [[imf]]

The Oakland Institute published a 2014 paper outlining what was described as a global corporate takeover of agricultural land in Ukraine. Ukraine has been hailed as the breadbasket of Europe, with a staggering 32 million plus hectares of incredibly fertile black arable soil. For gardeners, horticulturalists, or farmers, this means lush, rich, fertile growth with excellent crop yields and quality harvests. If you're Monsanto, one of the biggest agribusinesses on the planet, or one of a handful of other players buying into this hugely profitable location, the rights to ownership are extremely lucrative. Corruption, as always, exists at the highest level for the highest returns.

Ukraine's agricultural land was under a moratorium that banned its sale through 01/01/2016. When Ukraine separated from the Soviet Union in 1990, collectivized communal farms were disbanded, and land was distributed in parcels of approximately four hectares each to people living on those collectivized farms. In 02/2001, Ukraine passed its land code legislation that gave people functional titles to land. Since then, there's been a moratorium on the sale of land, extended through 01/01/2016. The moratorium applies only to agricultural land, making it both legal and affordable for investors to build and operate a 100% foreign-owned processing facility while leasing fields from agricultural landowners until the moratorium was lifted.

A second way investors could circumvent the land moratorium was by buying shares of large existing Ukrainian agribusinesses. The system of land distribution in the 1990s often led to concentration of land in the hands of a few elites. Alongside land, opportunities in Ukraine for development, production and use of agricultural inputs like seeds, agrochemicals and fertilizers have attracted investment by agribusiness giants: Monsanto, Cargill, DuPont and others.

**Andrew Murray:** So I was going to ask you, Doctor Pete, you had lots of other information to tie this together.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Everyone has heard about the International Monetary Fund offering Ukraine a $40 billion loan if they would stop the moratorium—specifically so Monsanto and the other giant corporations could concentrate ownership on a big corporate scale. There was a coup to make that happen because the elected president had rejected the IMF fund. The IMF, working with the World Bank and all the other so-called Western authorities, wanted to reverse that, stop the moratorium, so they supported the coup. The coup was very clear they were going to adapt laws that would let Monsanto take over. When the coup happened, that did take place. So they had to get rid of the legally elected president and establish the Zelensky government supporting the Monsanto privatization system.
