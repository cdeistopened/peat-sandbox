tags: [[andrew-murray]] [[sarah-johanneson-murray]] [[june-2022]]

**Andrew Murray**: Well, good evening and welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor. This is 06/17/2022. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray**: My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray.

**Andrew Murray**: So once again, welcome to the show, which runs from seven till 8:00. And at 7:30, we open the lines up to invite callers in with questions related to this month's topic, which is going to be around food and the corporation's control of food and some ongoing numbers and statistics from the COVID outfall. And then we're going to get into some parts of the political discourse and involvement in big companies in The Ukraine and fertilizer production. And then hopefully, we're going to get to the topic of the baby milk shortage, followed up with some artificial meat topics.

And as always, I have the great pleasure of having Doctor Raymond Peat join us with his superb overview of a lot of things. And I guess it's part of his age that enables him to encompass well over 70 years, but he's certainly older than that, but he encompasses at least forty, fifty years of time spent studying the subjects and another three decades on top of that of living for this amount of time to see the events unfolding that have done. So, he's got a pretty good rounded view of many different subjects and obviously, alternative medicine is one of them. And he's been, obviously spending a large part of his life and his career, looking at the research, which is always the most interesting part of any of this factual information. It's not just opinion.

So once again, very pleased to have Doctor Raymond Peat join us on the show. Doctor Peat, are you there? Yes. Okay. Well, if you don't mind me just for the next five minutes or so, I just wanted to run an introduction to some of the questions that I'll be asking you and getting your opinion on.

## Recap and Context from Previous Shows

But just wanted to wrap up last month's discourse. We talked about genetic modification and corporations with patent rights on intellectual property that they are saying, especially Monsanto, with their genetically engineered seeds and the quote unquote moratorium that was on natural products certainly seems to have been put to one side now where naturally occurring products like corn, wheat and potatoes etcetera, although they're natural, they have now been granted patent rights on their genetically modified versions of them.

And I think this also runs into technology and obviously the emerging infections that we've gone through since the late or mid-1990s up until now with COVID obviously being the major part of our prior two year discourse on the events of COVID. I also wanted to remind people that the lawyer, Reiner Fumisch, is, well, I think he's still presenting it but has a huge amount of data on the website which I would encourage everyone to look at as a superb chronologically documented series of allegations, which essentially is, charging crimes against humanity, for many organizations, institutions, and governments.

And that website is as a secure website, https://radical.org/pandemic-parallax-view. That should get you there. There's a bit more in the URL, but essentially, radical.org and then pandemic parallax view. So lists every detail about the beginning from the Wuhan lab, Fauci, the funding of it all up until the present point, and why people have been so hoodwinked over what's happened.

Also mentioned last month that the United Nations has changed the terminology from technocracy to green economy and sustainable development and how that impacts us all very negatively because it sounds so innocuous and harmless. Sustainable development. Who doesn't want sustainability? We all do. I do. I want local markets. I want people growing food locally. I don't want huge corporations shipping food from one side of the world to the other and displacing rural farmers, you know.

So we want sustainable development, but the words sustainable development have been couched in such a way as to embrace this technocracy, which we exposed last month as really beginning from about the 1920s. And Dr. Peat certainly weighed in on what he understands of technocracy having lived through it. And then obviously, the Rockefeller Foundation and all the other power players that are forming the heads of government institutions and global organizations, from the Codex Alimentarius series of programs that we did a long time ago. Rheem Olaybo has exposed that as being part of a world government order to get us all to this point that we've heard recently about the Great Reset.

## Insurance Company Mortality Data

So anyway, that was just an overview of last month. So I wanted just to open up this month and I hadn't mentioned this earlier, Doctor Peat, but it's something that caught my eye was that while I was looking at the information for this month's show, that the fifth largest life insurance company in The U.S. has just paid out 163% more for deaths of working people, folks. Not old old people just ready to die, but working people from 18 to 64. So that group, they paid out 163% more for deaths for that age group.

So company the company cites a non pandemic related morbidity and unusual claims adjustments is the explanation of losses from Group Life Insurance businesses. And the stock is falling and the CEO has been replaced, etcetera, and they're trying to prop this up. So the head of an Indianapolis based insurance company, One America, said the death rate is up a stunning forty percent from pre pandemic levels among working age people.

Now, five months after breaking this story of the CEO of One America insurance company saying deaths among working people ages 18 to 64 were up forty percent in the 2021, a new report is out that a much larger life insurance company namely Lincoln National reported 163% increase in death benefits paid out under its group life insurance policies in 2021. To quote One America, the company CEO, Scott Davidson, stated that we are seeing right now the highest death rates we've seen in the history of this business, not just at One America. The data is consistent across every player in the business.

Now One America is a $100,000,000,000 insurance company that has had its headquarters in Indianapolis since 1877. The company has approximately 2,400 employees and sells life insurance, including group life insurance to employees and employers in the state. And Davidson said the increase in death represents huge, huge numbers and that it's not elderly people who are dying, but primarily working age people, 18 through 64, who are the employees of companies that have group life insurance play plans through One America.

And what we saw just in third quarter, we're seeing it continue into fourth quarter, and that is that death rates are up forty percent over what they were pre pandemic. Just to give you an idea of how bad that is, a three sigma or a one in two hundred year catastrophe would be ten percent increase over pre pandemic. So forty percent is just unheard of. Now, what is driving this unprecedented surge in, quotes, all cause mortality?

It was not only deaths of working age people that shot up to unheard of levels in 2021, but also short and long term disability claims. Now if this holds true, then the genetic vaccine so aggressively promoted have failed. And the clear federal campaign to prevent early treatment with life saving drugs has contributed to a massive avoidable loss of life.

At worst, this report implies that the federal workplace vaccine mandates have driven what appeared to be a true crime against humanity. Massive loss of life in, presumably, workers that have been forced to accept a toxic vaccine at higher frequency relative to the general population of Indiana. And furthermore, we've also been living through the most massive globally coordinated propaganda and censorship campaign in the history of the human race.

All major mass media and the social media technology companies have coordinated to stifle and suppress any discussion of the risks of the genetic vaccines and or alternative early treatments. Between artificial intelligence powered algorithms and social media tech giants complicit in their communist style suppression of information, we've witnessed an avoidable mass casualty event, needlessly caused by a mandated experimental medical procedure which obliterated and eviscerated the first amendment of the constitution of The United States in the process.

## Understanding the Data and Insurance Company Accuracy

**Raymond Peat**: Several other companies since then have reported very similar increased mortality, around forty percent in the working age group. And so it's insurance companies generally have extremely accurate statistics, better than governments as a rule because their income depends on exactness. And so it's really the scientific basis for saying that, it wasn't the virus that's responsible but the vaccination. That's when the forty percent rise began. And it fits the virologists, the the skeptical virologists have been claiming that, that the mortality is going to be far, far worse from the vaccine than from whatever occurred from the virus.
