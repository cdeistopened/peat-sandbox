## Introduction and Dr. Peat's Background
tags: [[introduction]] [[background]] [[reproductive-physiology]] [[scientific-dogmatism]]

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome back to Ask Your Herb Doctor, KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM. Every month we have a guest speaker, and that guest speaker is the faithful, ever reliable, factual, informative Dr. Raymond Peat. And again this month is no exception. Dr. Peat's going to be joining us to discuss the continuing subject of cancer with reference to autoimmunity and estrogen. For those people who wish to call in, we invite you to call in. It's a live show. We encourage questions related to the subject, but obviously recognize there are instances where people are following protocols and they have questions related to that protocol or indeed any other subject. Dr. Peat's a wealth of information and outside of his area of expertise, he often has an answer for many different questions. This month is a continuation of a broader discussion on cancer, the alternative approaches to the treatment of cancer. Some new research that I found here from 2020 papers and 2019 papers that have been written on immunotherapy and estrogen and autoimmunity. So from 7:30 until the end of the show at 8:00, you're invited to call in. The number is 707-923-3911. So I think without further ado, let's make sure we've got Dr. Peat on the air.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes, I'm here.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for joining us. So for those people, as always, I start the shows off just in case—for those people who perhaps might not have read anything that you've written or heard you speak or know anything about you, perhaps it's always possible, new people coming all the time into the alternative scene. Would you just explain your academic and professional background before we get into the show?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay. When I graduated from college, that was in the humanities. I was an English major for a while and then an art and psychology and philosophy major for a while and worked for several years just in the humanities. But I was specializing in linguistics and wanted to understand how language works in the brain. So I decided to study biology to better understand the brain so I could understand language as a basis for understanding the culture and humanities and so on. But when I got to graduate school at University of Oregon, 1968, I learned that the brain scientists were the most dogmatic. Well, the geneticists were more dogmatic. The brain science people were high status and very dogmatic. So I looked around looking for people oriented towards science rather than dogmatism, and found that reproductive physiology people were actually doing research and not throwing away evidence that contradicted their basic ideas. So I specialized in the physiology of oxidative metabolism as it changes in the reproductive system with aging. And that happened to provide a good perspective on how to understand the brain and its energy. And so it was useful for my original project. And so then I wrote up Mind and Tissue, a little book about the history of people understanding brain metabolism in relation to psychology. And then for 10 or 20 years was specializing in the interactions of hormones and nutrition, counseling people on the effects of living and eating on your hormonal system and aging.

**Andrew Murray:** Something I picked up on there. You said that when you decided to follow up your undergraduate stuff, you said that the people, the reproductive physiology people, were far less likely to throw away good information related to the research and therefore a little bit more careful in sticking to scientific principles and not burying it. And I just want to ask you the question before we get into the subject matter, is this because the estrogen industry hadn't really gotten so much traction at this point? By this point, it was still in the early days of its push. And I guess it links tonight's show because we're talking about estrogen and autoimmunity. But did you say that those reproductive physiology people or the people in those departments weren't quite so inclined to throw this stuff away or mire it?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, my brain nerve biology professor in class described doing some research and he said, "and then you throw away the bad data in the lab." I would point out an instrument reading to him that was impossible by his ideas, and it just turned off his brain in a flash and he turned away. And I'm sure his memory was that he never saw that happen.

## Estrogen, AID Enzyme, and Genomic Destabilization
tags: [[estrogen]] [[aid-enzyme]] [[genomic-instability]] [[autoimmunity]] [[cancer]]

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, so Dr. Peat, getting back to the subject of tonight, estrogen, autoimmunity and cancer. I want to just quickly pull out basically a paragraph—it's kind of plagiarism, sorry for that, but interesting details.

**Engineer:** No, a paragraph is considered fair use as long as you cite where it came from.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, actually you know what? I don't have the article that was pulled from but it was one of those 2021 articles from PubMed. It's a university paper but I didn't actually have this one down. So it just said that: Why women are more susceptible to autoimmune diseases is not completely clear. But new data suggests that the hormone estrogen may play an important role. A new study now shows that estrogen activates the expression of AID, which is activation-induced deaminase, which is a protein that drives antibody diversification by deaminating cytosine in DNA to uracil. If estrogen increases the level of AID, increased mutations could transform benign antibodies into self anti-self pariahs. And AID might also contribute to cancer, particularly in breast tissue which is highly responsive to estrogen by introducing mutations and strand breaks into the genome. So I just wanted to read that out because in the conversation that I had earlier with Dr. Peat about tonight's show, he said that he was looking more and doing more research into autoimmunity and how estrogen unfavorably influences the immune system to basically become a self-destructive mechanism or by knocking out things like nuclear factor kappa beta.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** That article you cited is an extremely important landmark in not just autoimmunity but—one of the very earliest estrogen cancer researchers, Leonel Strong, showed that estrogen destabilizes the whole genome, promotes a tendency to develop an uneven number of chromosomes by losing or gaining an extra chromosome or piece of chromosome. So it's a genetic destabilizer. And that's exactly what this article you cite—it focuses on one single enzyme, which is when it functions, it helps to produce the essentially infinite variety of antibodies that we can make by creating extreme rate of mutation locally. But that same destabilizing process works on many levels, all the way to the shape and function of the basic cell, not just that one mutation-promoting enzyme. And when you look at these landmarks, it's important to keep in mind, but in between the big landmarks, like that article on the AID mutagenic enzyme, in between these landmarks you have an almost continuous, seamless bunch of other changes that estrogen is acting on and producing that all tend in the same direction. The reductionist, mechanistic approach just can't look at the fact. But wherever you look, probably thousands of different places are cooperating with that destabilizing effect on that one enzyme. Increasing the water content of the cell, for example, helps to destabilize the whole system, hardening collagen, lowering oxygen tension, increasing nitric oxide production, histamine production. Everywhere you look, it would take about an hour just to identify the main pro-inflammatory mechanisms that have been identified. But the interesting thing is it's holistic, almost seamlessly interacting, one factor supporting another factor.

**Andrew Murray:** Well, I'm very pleased that you said that. I was so happy to find the article. I couldn't hardly believe what I was reading because so often has been for the last 15 years, not quite that long with you. Obviously we met you in 2007, but since I've been looking at articles to do shows and to come up with information and to discuss things and bring to the greater awareness people's understanding of how they're being duped, as it were, by the system. And we'll talk a little bit later on towards the end of the show about the authoritarianism which you've often mentioned in science and in the university systems, how people have been duped by the status quo and what they're told to accept or not. But I couldn't hardly believe the article when I read it because along with that, and there was another one, a 2019 publication, that one was a 2021 publication. I was like, wow, they're actually saying this. They're actually saying it the way it is. This is what you've been saying for a long, long time. And I know we'll come back to that quip that you've mentioned years and years and years ago. You know, a lie gets around the world faster than truth can get tied up at shoelaces. But I was so heartened to see this article and read about it because researchers and scientists were actually disclosing this now and because it's been buried and hidden for so long because the estrogen industry is so powerful. And that's why I mentioned when you first started talking about your bio, you know, the people in reproductive physiology perhaps weren't so keen to throw stuff away because they weren't as brainwashed, perhaps probably because the estrogen industry hadn't got as much traction as it has now, both in Congress as well as in pharmaceutical frameworks that there's so much money behind it now that it's very easy to just blind people to the truth and keep perpetuating the lie in an authoritarian fashion, which the medical system emphasizes and epitomizes completely.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I've often wondered how my thesis advisor, Arnold Soderwall, how he came to be so open to the facts and resistance to the industry position. And I think it was partly that he was born and educated before the power of the industry took over. And so he was aware of the research that was done in the 1930s, absolutely contradicting everything that since 1944 the estrogen industry has foisted upon the public.

## Estrogen's Role in Autoimmunity - B Cells vs T Cells
tags: [[autoimmunity]] [[b-cells]] [[t-cells]] [[thymus]] [[antibodies]] [[inflammation]]

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, okay, we're getting to the meat and potatoes, as it were, of what you've recently been researching as a continuation of a thread you've held for a long time, along with the polyunsaturates being so damaging for the system both genetically and energetically. So far as autoimmunity and estrogen is concerned, I pulled out quite a few little snippets from either PubMed or other Internet source documents that are researched and validated by references to the articles by which they're claiming that what they're saying is the way it is. So the autoimmunity feature or the autoimmunity predisposing activity of estrogen and how it's so negative, not just because it's cancer forming, but in terms of its destabilizing things, as you mentioned, like waterlogging the cell and decreasing the energy availability and causing chaos in the cell generally, how this can result in chromosomal changes, but autoimmunity per se—how do you see estrogen driving that in terms of what you're currently seeing and building on?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The pro-inflammatory part of inflammation and immunity that is activated by estrogen such as histamine, nitric oxide and serotonin—it's an essential part of getting things started. But the next step is to turn off the excitatory process that got things started and focus on maturing the cells. Once they got shaken up by a little inflammation, then you have to give form to it. And estrogen releasing histamine, for example, activates many other pro-inflammatory things and activates cells, gets cell division going and increases the production of antibodies. The B cells are activated by estrogen and the thymus cells. The whole thymus gland shrinks very quickly in the presence of either estrogen or glucocorticoid steroids. And if you knock out the thymus T cells that restrain antibody production, things like this enzyme you just cited, AID, those become more and more dominant. The B cells being activated in many ways by estrogen, including knocking out the restraint from the T cells, that creates a varied sort of random irrational activity of the antibodies being produced by this overactivity of the B cells. And in that relatively random activity, that's where some of the antibodies cause damage rather than contributing to cleaning up the infection process.

## Progesterone as Counterbalance to Estrogen
tags: [[progesterone]] [[pregnancy]] [[healing]] [[thyroid]] [[lupus]] [[dhea]]

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So what goes wrong, Dr. Peat? If the estrogen is an important stimulator of inflammation for healing purposes, at what point does it go wrong or why does it go wrong that it then becomes a chronic inflammatory stimulator?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, it's exactly the same thing that happens in pregnancy. Estrogen and histamine create a little focus of activity in the uterus and inflammation that the conceptus takes advantage of and gets into the uterus. But then if that process of local inflammation, histamine and estrogen kept dominating, it would interfere with the oxygen and glucose supply to the fetus. Yeah, you've got to stop the excitation and the inflammation before the pregnancy can really start by delivering glucose and oxygen to the tissue. So it's progesterone rising. One of the natural functions of estrogen is to evoke the progesterone receptor, making the cells open to being turned off by progesterone. So it's sort of an automatic process. The estrogen should excite and inflame the tissue, but immediately turn the tissue towards looking for relief from progesterone by increasing the progesterone receptor. And if you can produce progesterone, partly acting through the progesterone receptor, partly outside that way of influencing—one of the first effects of progesterone is to knock out the estrogen in roughly 10 different ways. Progesterone knocks out those pro-inflammatory effects of estrogen, turning off the production of estrogen, knocking out the estrogen receptor so the tissue is less sensitive to estrogen and changing the metabolism and so on. And that—exactly what happens to make pregnancy possible is what happens every time you have a little injury that evokes the estrogen-activated start of the healing or immune process that should increase the cell's ability to receive and be saved or matured by progesterone produced elsewhere in the organism.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So for women that have autoimmune conditions, is that something you would recommend they use as progesterone to help combat the inflammatory overactive, immune stimulating effects of the estrogen?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. People are now recognizing the role of progesterone along with DHEA and thyroid. But over the last 50 years or so I've seen several women with seriously debilitating effects of lupus, SLE, lupus erythematosus, just by taking thyroid and progesterone. All of their symptoms over several weeks faded away.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Faded away because the thyroid is combating the estrogen, helping improve the liver's ability to excrete it and detoxify it and increasing the oxygen to the cell to get it to work better. So it can not be over-manufacturing inflammatory mediators.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And making more progesterone and helping the progesterone production to counterbalance the high estrogen.

## Environmental Estrogens - Plastics and Water Contamination
tags: [[environmental-estrogens]] [[plastics]] [[bisphenol-a]] [[water-contamination]] [[birth-control-pills]]

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And Dr. Peat, what role do you think like plastics in our environment play stimulating estrogens? I mean, is this something that we're now going to be permanently scarred with—women and men, children?

**Andrew Murray:** I'm glad you mentioned that because that's actually part of another question I had for him later on. But carry on.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The water—birth control pills getting into the sewage, much of it ends up in the water of rivers and recycles. And there are natural sources of estrogens, but just the tremendous flow of estrogen down the sewers is a tremendous polluting source. But the plastics, the agents used to make stiff plastics more flexible are effective estrogen in very small amounts. And all of the water supply of the world is contaminated with those.

**Andrew Murray:** They're saying that the levels of cancer now that they're putting down there, and I'm glad you said that. Back up, Sarah, to just say that one of the questions I was going to pose to you is around bisphenol-A and the catastrophe that we're seeing worldwide with environmental contaminants from the plastics industry is fueling the cancer rates worldwide because it's directly implicated in the estrogenization of the organism, male or female, as well as fish and everything else that's swimming about in the water. So you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor, KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM. Dr. Raymond Peat, PhD is with us and we are discussing the subject of autoimmunity, cancer and estrogen. Right about now, 7:30 to 8:00, you're invited to call in with questions either directly posed to Dr. Peat on the subject or any other health questions that you have. The number here is 707-923-3911.

## Viruses and Autoimmune Disease
tags: [[viruses]] [[oncogenic-viruses]] [[epstein-barr]] [[autoimmune-thyroid]] [[inflammation]]

**Andrew Murray:** Well, let's not quite get into plastics yet, but I think just on the subject of autoimmunity and how the immune system basically targets itself when it's under the effects of estrogen and how that can fuel cancer through chromosomal changes and damage that puts the body's immune surveillance outside of the range of doing what it should do, but turns it against itself. I looked at—because they've always said, well, not always said, but fairly recently in the last 15, 20 years have been saying that viruses, oncogenic viruses have been discovered and that they posited then 20, 30 years ago perhaps that these viruses may well be implicated in spontaneous cancer arising. And I remember things like wart viruses being implicated in the production of cancers. But Epstein-Barr virus is also another one of those I saw in some recent research related to autoimmune disease such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves disease, rheumatoid—and then you mentioned lupus and Sjogren's syndrome. So the viral interference, as it were, towards promoting destabilization and autoimmune thyroid disease from viral inclusions as autoimmunity. Do you go along with that kind of theory?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the same inflammation that leads to the direct actions of estrogen on the T and B cells and on their ability to make the safe type of antibodies—whatever the inflammation is, is affecting all of the cells of your body, shifting them a little bit to the unstable tendency to lack enough oxygen and take up more water than is desirable.

## Petrochemical-Pharmaceutical Industry Complex
tags: [[petrochemicals]] [[pharmaceutical-industry]] [[des]] [[prostate-cancer]] [[authoritarianism]]

**Andrew Murray:** I've got a—do we have a caller on the air? Our first one for this evening. So let's hold you right there, Dr. Peat, and take this first caller. Caller, where are you from? What's your question?

**Caller (Joe from Squirrel Ridge):** I was wondering if there's a correlation between the plastics makers and the pharmaceutical industry.

**Andrew Murray:** A correlation between the plastics makers industry, the plastics industry, yes, the plastic people who are making the plastics, the people who are holding the patents to chemotherapy. Yeah, I don't doubt that for a minute. But Dr. Peat, in terms of petrochemical industries and pharmaceutical companies, what do you think about that collusion, perhaps?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** It is a known fact that the Roundup company also holds the patents to the medicine that cures the same illness or pretends to cure the symptoms of the illness that the dandelion root would cure.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, I totally agree. Dr. Peat, what do you have to say?

**Caller:** The other question I have—when will they be held accountable for destroying this earth?

**Andrew Murray:** When will they be held accountable for a lot of things. Hopefully that's hope. We all hope for that. So let's not give up hope. But Dr. Peat, what do you think about petrochemical pharmaceutical collusion?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, those are the most powerful industries next to the military arms industry. And they have had control of the government regulatory agencies for well over 100 years. And it's a less powerful industry, the asbestos industry. Compared to pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals, asbestos wasn't such a huge powerful industry. But it took about 100 years to reduce the public's exposure to carcinogenic levels of asbestos. So the government is working against the public on matters of pollution.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And also Dr. Peat, haven't you told us that estrogen is manufactured from petrochemical products?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The original ones were diethylstilbestrol. It was so cheap. It was a perfect drug. Cost nothing to manufacture but it had very powerful estrogen-like effects that—it was continuing to be used to treat prostate cancer into the very end of the 20th century. They were still using it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And that's what you believe causes prostate cancer, right? Is the estrogen.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And that treatment was based on zero evidence. It was a total matter of opinion contrary to all of the research in animals. But it affected many millions of men for about 55 years.

**Andrew Murray:** It sounds like the true mark of the authoritarian.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** True.

## Anti-Estrogenic Compounds - DIM and Bitter Melon
tags: [[dim]] [[bitter-melon]] [[cruciferous-vegetables]] [[estrogen-modulators]]

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, so you're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor, KMUD Garberville 91.1 FM. Dr. Raymond Peat, our special guest here to answer questions either about the subject—tonight's autoimmunity, cancer and estrogen—or any other health related questions you have that you feel Dr. Peat has the answer for. And he has the answer. So the number here 707-923-3911. I want to make a little departure from autoimmunity per se but just ask you—and I've got a little kind of paragraph of some work I saw that I think I don't know if you'll go along with it, but let me just see if you will. What do you think about diindolylmethane? Because I have an article about DIM for anti-estrogenic purposes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There were studies in fish in which it had a pro-estrogenic effect. So I've been a little skeptical of it. But to the extent that you can show, for example in humans that it is protective, then it's a pretty safe material to just eat your cabbage and broccoli.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Kale. I like kale.

**Andrew Murray:** All right. And then I saw, from a botanical perspective, it interests me. I caught it right away because I remember working in the Botanic Gardens in Cambridge, this plant, this climbing cucurbitaceous plant in the cucumber family called Momordica charantia, bitter melon. They're saying that it has strong estrogen modulating properties and that in rats bitter melon reduced estrogen levels notably. And another study found four specific constituents from bitter melon possess significant antagonism of estradiol and estrogen receptors. So I wonder if that plant caught my attention for any other reasons other than that. But I thought it was quite pertinent. These bright orange kind of gourds, but not gourd shaped, but they're kind of like swollen cucumbers with lots of spines on them. So getting back to autoimmunity and other substances that affect estrogen and decrease estrogen's ability to wreak havoc on the chromosome and to reduce T helper cells and the other parts of the immune system so that it can evade detection and or be arrested much sooner than it is in most people.

## Endotoxin, PUFAs, and Estrogen Synergy
tags: [[endotoxin]] [[pufa]] [[polyunsaturated-fats]] [[prostaglandins]] [[leaky-gut]]

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There are two factors that powerfully go with the inflammation and destabilizing effect of estrogen, adding to the tendency to develop autoimmunity. One is endotoxin. And if you're overloaded with estrogen, your blood vessels tend to be leaky. And that in itself increases the risk of exposure to endotoxin, which intensifies that leakiness and affects all of your cells, tending to make them leaky or overloaded with water and having the signs of inflammation. The other main factor is the polyunsaturated fatty acids and the prostaglandins that they are converted to. Both free polyunsaturated fatty acids—they have a direct effect, activating estrogen, for example, knocking out the estrogen binding protein so that the estrogen is freed to be more active and effective and increasing the ability of cells to take up the polyunsaturated fats. And then under the influence of estrogen, the excitatory prostaglandins are activated. In a healthy situation, the prostaglandins are blocked by progesterone in multiple ways, stopping the synthesis and accelerating the degrading metabolism of the prostaglandins. So the balance, once you shift over to the estrogen influence, you're at increased risk from the polyunsaturated fats and the endotoxin coming from your intestine.

## Gluten, Transglutaminase, and Autoimmune Thyroiditis
tags: [[gluten]] [[gliadin]] [[transglutaminase]] [[celiac-disease]] [[thyroid]] [[molecular-mimicry]]

**Andrew Murray:** All right, good. I'm glad you mentioned that endotoxin and leaky gut, because there was another direct article that associated leaky gut with being the initial insult that allowed these fragments to pass across into the bloodstream and set up autoimmunity because they're recognized as foreign. And some of these substances, they mentioned things like gliadin from gluten and that protein. I couldn't actually—I didn't actually have the time to look at it. I looked at the structure of triiodothyronine and thyroxine. Someone was saying, I can't quote the person's name, but I've got a small paragraph from their article. They said that the gliadin molecule was very similar to T3 and T4 structure and how when gliadin got across a leaky gut and the permeability allowed that kind of thing to happen, that was within the bloodstream. Our own immune system, unfortunately, would recognize that gliadin molecule as being so similar to thyroid that it would actually cause an autoimmune thyroiditis as a consequence. Do you know anything about gluten structure?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, yeah. For a long time, the celiac disease has been increasing right along with the exposure to estrogen. It has gone from mostly a childhood disease to mostly in adult women. And there are several things that overlap antigenically with the tissues under the influence of estrogen and gluten, and in particular—

**Andrew Murray:** Can I hold you there? I don't mean to interrupt you, Dr. Peat, but we've got two callers on the air, so let's take these two callers first and then we'll carry on.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Yes, because we definitely want to—I want to hear what he has to say about the interaction of gluten and estrogen. If we have time.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, let's note gluten. I'll make a note of that. But Dr. Peat, let's take this first caller out of two. Caller, you're on the air, where you're from. What's your question?

## Caller Q&A: Top Carcinogenic Foods
tags: [[carcinogenic-foods]] [[pufa]] [[seed-oils]] [[tryptophan]] [[methionine]] [[iron]]

**Caller:** Hi, actually, I'm in Garberville right now. You guys started touching on this. So maybe it's a perfect time to ask. But I was going to ask—I don't want to limit it to 3 or 4, but what are like 3 foods or 3 categories of foods one can avoid that you would say are highly carcinogenic. And as far as the worst foods for you to put in your body, how would you say that would compare? I don't know if you can compare it to say smoking cigarettes. Thank you.

**Andrew Murray:** So carcinogenic foods. What would you say will be the top three carcinogenic foods?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, polyunsaturated fats, any vegetable seed oil.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Liquid seed oil that is polyunsaturated. Olive oil is 90% monounsaturated, 10% polyunsaturated. Otherwise all the other seed oils are polyunsaturated.

**Andrew Murray:** So, Dr. Peat, PUFA the first one, how about number two?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I would put the pro-inflammatory amino acids, tryptophan I would say was number two, methionine, cysteine and tryptophan.

**Engineer:** And what are some foods that contain those?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** High quality proteins in excess.

**Andrew Murray:** Things like lots and lots of turkey.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Well, so that's basically not more than 4 ounces of meat per day is what you have generally recommended for someone trying to avoid carcinogenic excess of protein.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, definitely. You don't want to eat a pound or pound and a half of meat per day.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, so PUFA, pro-inflammatory amino acids, particularly tryptophan. And what else do you think—number three contender for cancerous foods?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I'm not sure. Anything that contains a very great excess of iron I think should have a high spot.

**Engineer:** And how does that relate to smoking a pack a day of cigarettes?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** How does it relate to what?

**Engineer:** Yeah, so how is, say, having a diet rich in PUFAs compared in cancer risk to smoking a pack a day of cigarettes? American cigarettes.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Oh, the PUFA is probably the biggest carcinogenic part of the American diet.

## Whole Grains, Rancidity, and Industrial Meat
tags: [[whole-grains]] [[rancidity]] [[white-rice]] [[chicken]] [[pork]] [[industrial-agriculture]]

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, that was the first caller. Thanks for your question, caller. So let's move on to the second caller. Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from? What's your question?

**Caller:** Yes, good evening. I'm calling from Garberville as well. I was curious. You answered my first question, which was—I eat a lot of olive oil, which is unfiltered, which is fabulous stuff. So you've answered that question already, the monounsaturated. So the second question was in relationship to our other caller who asked what the most carcinogenic foods were. Does whole wheat flour fall under that? And how about—are the constituents of chicken a healthy thing to eat? And I'll take my answer off air. Thank you very much, gentlemen.

**Andrew Murray:** Whole wheat flour.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The reason flour and grains were polished, white rice, for example, and white flour is that the whole grains get rancid and toxic fairly quickly in storage. And so if you're going to eat the whole wheat flour soon after it's ground, it's probably not so bad. But still, once it gets in your blood, those excess polyunsaturated fats are starting to react with iron in your blood to produce lipid peroxides and free radical toxins. The polished rice has very little nutritional value, but has at least a way to avoid the worse effects of storage toxins.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** The rancidity is not going to go rancid. White rice.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, very, very little rancidity.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So it prevents starvation because it doesn't have any other nutrients besides the carbohydrate calories.

**Engineer:** Actually, I found myself sitting by an Asian American professor of nutrition and I asked him, you know, hippies eat brown rice, obviously that's best. Why isn't that done in Asia? And he said that was a storage issue because with white rice there's not enough nutrition that a weevil can't reproduce. But if they're eating whole grain meals or grains, then they're able to reproduce and you get an infestation instead of just losing a few grains.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Well, there's another reason.

**Engineer:** Yeah, because it was stored. Everybody there ate tons of vegetables and some high quality meat. And so it wasn't an issue of fiber and vitamins. It was a storable, transportable food for armies and bureaucrats. And the caller asked about chicken, your specific view on chicken too?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** On a typical industrial diet, chicken is full of very unstable polyunsaturated fats. And I think it in excess is pretty carcinogenic.

**Engineer:** But if you had access to good, fresh, locally raised chicken from a varied diet, no more than 4 ounces a day is okay?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think so. It's same with pork. Industrial pork has over 30% PUFA in the fat. And if people are careful what they feed their pigs, the fat goes down almost like beef—4% PUFA of the fat.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** If you're not feeding them corn and all those PUFA-rich grains, then the fat of the chicken and the fat of the pork or the pig will be less full of those toxic polyunsaturated or PUFA oils. We call them PUFA.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, like the traditional pig diet of whey and old vegetables.

## Transglutaminase Connection Between Gluten and Estrogen

**Andrew Murray:** Okay. You're listening to Ask Your Herb Doctor, KMUD Garberville, 91.1 FM. From now until the close of the show, probably at five to the hour, you're invited to call in—707-923-3911. Dr. Peat, before you lose the train of thought, not that you do lose too much, if anything—gluten and estrogen. And so I wanted to make sure that we got that connection.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, the enzyme transglutaminase is in common between gluten and, for example, the lining of the intestine acted upon by estrogen. And so if we have antibodies to the foreign protein gluten, they will act against our own tissues as far as they're under the influence of estrogen which induces the transglutaminase. And the transglutaminase aspect of estrogen—it's the cross-linking enzyme that hardens collagen. And under the influence of estrogen producing transglutaminase, collagen itself becomes hardened and carcinogenic rather than flexible.

**Andrew Murray:** Interesting. We have another caller on the air so let's go there first.

**Engineer:** He was able to do it in five—opinion on eating flax, sorry, hemp seed and pumpkin seed.

**Andrew Murray:** Hemp seed versus pumpkin seed or either or both.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** They are not necessarily the worst for the PUFA, but I wouldn't say it's something that you should do regularly because of the breakdown products. They're probably fairly rancid by the time you ingest them anyway.

## Construction Materials and Chemical Exposure

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, we've got one more caller on the air and I think we're going to leave this next caller to be the last one just so that the engineer can clear up for 8 o'clock and I'm going to carry on talking with you, Dr. Peat. So let's take this next caller. Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from? What's your question?

**Caller (Corey from Redway):** I'm from Redway and my question is, you know, I'm a construction worker so I work with, you know, the typical construction materials be they, you know, laminated glues, butyl, ABS glue—I cut ABS pipe all the time and I would assume those are exuding the same kind of the bioestrogens that you're referring to. And then, you know, there's also insulation and I would really love to hear a program if you don't mind me hijacking it for a second to talk about the things that the general public are exposed to on a daily basis. But I would love to hear about ABS and PVC, polyvinyl chloride and how those chemicals react. And I'm afraid I didn't listen to your show before this, but I would really love to know because I do work with them often.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah. Well, Dr. Peat, let's—thank you for your question, Corey. Let's give it over to Dr. Peat first and then just remind you that on our website we do run 85% of the shows that we've done. I still have a lot to put up from 2020 and 2021, unfortunately. It's some of the hottest stuff we've done actually on COVID. But Dr. Peat, the building materials, I mean, not just in California with their supposed safe regulations and we'll get into that at some other point, but the glues and the PVCs and all of the sealants and solvents.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Krazy Glue, I hate the smell of that stuff.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Even the safety law system, as far as it's existing, it's really part of a superstructure that enforces the use of the dangerous materials. They have laws to supposedly protect you against them, but the basic system is designed to direct production towards these cheapest and most dangerous chemicals. In the long run, 10 years or more, I think the problem would be solved very economically instead of continuing the deforestation to make lumber and plywood and so on, and then support fire departments to put out houses that are burning down. Living in Mexico, I was interested that there are practically no fire departments because they're all mud and cement. And mud and cement are very cheap building materials. They pollute very little. You grind up some rocks, can make your house any shape you want. And it's chemically inert once it gets in place.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, you can burn seashells and make your own lime, slaked lime.

## Dietary Strategies for Estrogen Detoxification

**Engineer:** So what are some dietary strategies? If you've been working all day with these horrible chemicals, what should you eat and what should you do to get that stuff out of your body?

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** That's what I was just going to ask Dr. Peat in the last couple minutes of this show. Let's discuss some ways to help protect ourselves against the carcinogenic effects of estrogen. And I know you've gone on about raw grated carrot and how effective they are at helping to decrease the endotoxin that we were talking about earlier. But also that they can actually absorb estrogen from the bowel.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Any good fiber that isn't too poisonous. Carrots have their own poisons, but the fiber keeps us from absorbing—when it's raw carrot and moderately shredded, we absorb very little of the irritating or toxic chemicals. But other fibers you might find more agreeable, anything from well-cooked mushrooms or bamboo shoots even to well-cooked bran. Oat bran, for example, has that fiber effect of getting the estrogen out of your intestine so it doesn't recycle and poison your liver. And so keeping the intestine as clean as possible means also keeping a rapid transit time and avoiding irritating foods that could cause inflammation and constipation. And part of the effect is to watch that your thyroid isn't suppressed because that will slow the elimination of estrogen. So keeping your metabolic rate up, keeping a temperature around 98.6 during the peak of the daytime, that will tend to give you a quick peristalsis and get things through your intestine before they have a chance to irritate and produce endotoxin and recycle estrogen.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And the other two supplements that are very helpful with keeping estrogen at bay—in our food, calcium is definitely one of them that helps to keep estrogen levels low. And vitamin D, those are two other supplements that you can take or, you know, hopefully you're getting your calcium from dairy and green leafy vegetables.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And because they keep your metabolic rate higher the way thyroid does, the calcium, especially from low-fat milk supported by vitamin D, both are very good for weight loss.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And then lastly, one last thing is progesterone is a direct combat molecule to estrogen.

## Closing Remarks and Show Information

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, let's hold it there folks. Thank you so much for your time, Dr. Peat. I'll just give out your information here. For those of you who've listened to the show, Dr. Raymond Peat—RayPeat.com, plenty of articles to read, lots of science backing it. Our website, westernbotanicalmedicine.com—we've got probably 12 years, 13, 14 years of archive shows. I've got all of the shows from 2020 and 2021 to go up. Unfortunately haven't done it, been very busy. But there are lots of COVID shows there to show how ridiculous this entire farce is.

I wanted just to finish up the show—we're going to discuss a little bit about authoritarianism. And I just this afternoon when I was getting the stuff together for the show, during the course of the afternoon here, came up with what I want to read out now. And it's just like a bit of a eulogy for you guys listening out there and for people for future prosperity. But basically I called it Authoritarianism and the Age of Acceptance. Have it all and have nothing.

We're evolving as a species and with our evolution comes the concept of deranged acceptance. Nature is not accepting, but rather through evolutionary pressure it selects the fittest and is quite barbaric. It takes no prisoners and is quite merciless. Rules exist and nature obeys them, set from the foundation of the world, which we recently have also learned to meddle with and derange like viruses. And gain of function research and the origins of COVID—the opposite perhaps of the all encompassing embrace of everything is allowable are the immutable laws set in place which we are constrained to, like time, gravity and death.

Authoritarianism, like cultural Marxism, is at odds with our founding father's constitution of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, which is a God-ordained decree, immutable and self-evident, echoing Martin Luther King's famous speech from the Emancipation Proclamation. Like gain of function research and authoritarianism, these are set at odds with their counterpart and are to be resisted with your life. Evolution demands that fitness be preserved and aimed at physically and spiritually. And so with increasing authoritarianism and draconian legislation aimed at making us happier—to coexist with everything, accept everything, have no boundaries and have no morals. I'll leave you with: have at it or resist and live.

2022 will soon be here, but we will move on. And for those who have ears, let them hear what the spirit says. Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to you all. My name's Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Thanks for tuning in tonight.

**Andrew Murray:** Good night.
