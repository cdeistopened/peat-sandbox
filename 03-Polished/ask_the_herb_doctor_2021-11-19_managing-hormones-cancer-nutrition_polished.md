## Dr. Peat's Background and Cancer Research
tags: [[aging]] [[hormones]] [[cancer-metabolism]] [[reproductive-hormones]]

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor, the November 19th, 2021 edition. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Welcome to our show, Ask Your Herb Doctor.

**Andrew Murray:** For those of you who just joined us or have never heard the show before, it runs every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 PM. We have a live call-in from 7:30 until the close of the show. As has become very customary now, Dr. Peat is our guest and joining us to share his knowledge. Last month in October, we opened up a discussion which we couldn't finish in a month, and it was concerning metabolic defects in cancer and also the approach to cancer—the strategies or alternative approaches to cancer. And Dr. Peat has for 35, 40 years been researching and working in alternative medicine, approaches to physiology, and has a website with a wealth of information that we'll be giving out towards the end of the show. So let me just check if Dr. Peat is with us. Dr. Peat, you with us?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yes.

**Andrew Murray:** Thanks so much for giving your time again this month. Would you just let people know more about you from an academic research perspective?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In the 1960s, I was studying various subjects in the humanities, and I decided to go into biology to study the brain mainly. But when I got to graduate school in 1968, my interest went to aging and its influence on the metabolism of, largely, the reproductive process—how reproduction influences the general process of aging. And since then, I've been following up the same general topics: aging, stress, sickness, and especially how the hormones—reproductive hormones—can accelerate or retard the process of aging.

**Andrew Murray:** So in terms of hormonal physiology for aging, that's been a specialism. I know you've worked in many other related branches of that surrounding natural healthcare. Last month we opened up a discussion on the alternative approaches to cancer with an emphasis on the metabolic defects, which you have fairly set principles that you have uncovered over time—some of which obviously don't line up with regular medicine. I know you have a very alternative perspective towards treating people. And I think I'm right in saying that the "first do no harm" rationale would be something you hold quite closely. Modern cancer therapy—chemotherapy and radiotherapy—I don't think these are modalities of which you are at all in favor of. But that's a very personal choice that each patient going through cancer therapy has to confront.

But obviously, with herbal medicine and alternative medicines, most people are perhaps looking for alternatives and not conventional treatment. Anyway, last month we covered cellular mitochondrial activity and how that produces energy. We discussed the myth of sugar being cancer-promoting, which is fairly rife in the mainstream. It seems to be repeated almost daily that sugar's something to be avoided for almost everything. And you've dispelled that myth for sure. Then the neuroendocrine dysregulation you mentioned—things like estrogen driving not only breast cancer, but other cancers—and then the so-called hypothalamic pituitary axis, where stress produces cortisol and through chronic stress the immune system can suffer. And how this is all part and parcel of a weakened organism that does in some ways predispose to the lack of surveillance.

So the last thing I think we got to was looking at redox balancing and mentioning that flavonoids—a fairly diverse group of plant products in many different areas—can be used to quench free radical damage, which is part and parcel also of cancer in its own right. I had some abstracts that got my interest. I know you're a big proponent of saturated fats and you do not at all adhere to polyunsaturates as being in any way healthy or beneficial for the organism. And actually, inflammation and destruction are caused by them. So the abstracts I was looking at were things like lipid peroxidation, which we have talked about on many different shows at many different times. And this peroxidation and byproducts of lipid metabolism or lipid oxidation is what happens. These have been shown to promote cancer. So the whole rationale of people using these omega-3s and omega-6s and fish oils as being, quote, "healthy" is absolutely not what you want to be using if you've got a cancer diagnosis or even if you don't have a cancer diagnosis. How about that?

## Fish Oil and Polyunsaturated Fats: The Metastasis Connection
tags: [[fish-oil]] [[omega-3]] [[metastasis]] [[liver-cancer]] [[lipid-peroxidation]]

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A couple of the abstracts you're referring to mentioned that on a high fish oil diet, the metastasis was about 1,000 times worse than on a low-fat diet or even a fat-free diet. Just a huge difference from supplementing fish oil versus not having fat. And we can make all of the unsaturated and saturated fats that we need from carbohydrates. So we don't really need any fats in the diet except for the pleasant taste and helping to absorb other nutrients. These abstracts in particular show the tremendous pro-metastatic effect of the fish oil fats.

**Andrew Murray:** I saw the other references, particularly for liver metastases and cancer growth in the liver. Obviously the liver is one of the major organs blood flows through. And so vascular-borne cancers that travel to different sites through the vasculature can certainly become lodged in the liver, and the liver itself—because it's a kind of sinusoidal organ like a sponge, if you will—a matrix of very many capillaries and openings and ducts and places where cancers can settle and grow—are quite often seen in cancer as a secondary spread to the liver. The other articles I saw said that these omega-3s in particular—I think the omega-6s were also implicated—but the omega-3s promoted cancer metastasis to the liver. And again, there was a direct causal relationship between these omega-3s and liver metastases.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So this lipid peroxidation, or rancid fat—when we eat fat, it can go rancid if it's not saturated. And that's known as lipid peroxidation. That applies not only to the fish oils but also to all the vegetable seed oils—right? Like canola, soy, and all the vegetable oils.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The more highly unsaturated they are, the quicker they break down. And some of the oxidative breakdown is almost immediate. Just as soon as it gets absorbed from your intestine and shows up in your bloodstream, you can find the highly oxidized breakdown fragments of the polyunsaturated fats like fish oil.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Did I hear you correctly stating that metastasis is 1,000 times worse on a fatty diet versus a non-fat diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** A couple of these studies found that the number and quantity of identifiable metastatic cancer were, in these cases, 1,000 times higher.

**Andrew Murray:** And this would again lead to... yeah, people that have talked about ketogenic diets—this is absolutely the last thing you want to be doing, right?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. And in the process of getting the ketogenic effect, basically it's starvation and stress that turns on so-called ketone production. But actually, one of the major ketone bodies is not a ketone, but an alcohol with a hydroxyl group as a potential ketone. In the hydroxyl state which is formed during the ketogenic diet, this becomes a reductant having an effect similar to lactic acid, which is a trigger to shift oxidation towards fermentation or the lactic acid metabolism typical of cancer.

And once anything interferes with your ability to oxidize glucose fully, that liberates any stored fatty acids you have in your tissues. And everyone has an abundance of fat mixed right into their functioning tissues. And in the ketogenic state, you are releasing free fatty acids into the bloodstream. And all of the liberated free fatty acids that have been studied promote metastasis. It isn't just the extremely toxic fish oil type, but just the fact of being a fatty acid rather than a sugar.

Many years ago, someone named Randle noticed that if you increase the fat in your diet and it turns into free fatty acids, the free fatty acids block the particular enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase, which lets us oxidize glucose all the way to carbon dioxide. And the free fatty acids directly activate the enzyme that knocks out our ability to oxidize glucose. And so once you get ketogenic from some degree of starvation, then you're poisoning your ability to fully oxidize glucose. That leaves it producing lactic acid. And when the pyruvate dehydrogenase is poisoned by various things, but especially free fatty acids, then you shift over to the cancer metabolism, producing lactic acid, which shifts the metabolism of other cells in the same direction.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So would that apply to saturated fat, but at a lesser extent?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, in some cases certain saturated fats don't do that at all. But on average, whenever it's been studied, the Randle effect works as soon as our glucose oxidation is interfered with by rising free fatty acids.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Right. So this isn't really alternative medicine because this is scientifically-backed and researched information that Dr. Peat is sharing with us tonight that might not be applied in orthodox medical treatment of cancer, but this is in no way on the fringe of science. This is scientific information.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. It actually represents more than 60 years of investigating what is actually happening in the metabolism of stress and cancer. And the whole thing that has developed in the last 50 years of saying that cancer eats sugar, cancer lives on sugar, and therefore if you stop eating sugar, you'll starve cancer—that's absolutely 100% wrong.

What sugar starvation does is cause the Randle cycle to take effect, blocking your ability to oxidize sugar fully. So you ferment, producing lactic acid, which promotes more of the cancer metabolism and creates inflammation and raises the cortisol stress hormones that break down proteins to make more glucose or amino acids, which will feed the cancer. The fatty acids themselves are good food for the cancer, but at a certain point of wasting away from cancer, fatty acids aren't very abundant in the body. And so the lactic acid metabolism is maintained by turning body proteins into glucose and amino acids to support the lactic acid metabolism of cancer.

## Sugar and Carbohydrates as Anti-Cancer Strategy
tags: [[sugar]] [[carbohydrates]] [[sucrose]] [[grape-diet]] [[anti-inflammatory]]

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** So in general, when you consult with people that might have cancer, would you recommend them to eat then a non-fat or very low-fat diet and a very high sucrose and fructose diet?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. Carbohydrates in general, especially sucrose.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Which is sugar, folks. And honey and sugar are chemically identical.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, I think it was last month I mentioned the grape diet. It was famous in the 1940s and 1950s. It was a very high glucose and sucrose diet combined with a very high intake of the anti-inflammatory flavonoids. But those are two of the very important anti-cancer agents: the anti-inflammatory component of the diet that you get in fruits and vegetables, and then the abundance of the minerals and other nutrients of fruit, but an abundance of sucrose so that you don't resort to any tendency to liberate fatty acids.

## The Interstitium and Lymphatic System in Cancer Metastasis
tags: [[interstitium]] [[lymphatics]] [[phytolacca]] [[herbal-medicine]] [[breast-cancer]]

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, I wanted to question you about something that from a herbal medicine perspective is very important—basically as an anti-cancer strategy as well as recognizing the actual function and value of the lymphatics. I know in breast cancer, lymph nodes obviously become congested. They pick up cancer cells, they are treating them. They are primarily white cells, surveillance sites with other cells that are killer cells, et cetera. They're doing some kind of routine surveillance of all of the fluids that are constantly passing through them.

But I wanted to get to the point of something that a few years ago—now it hasn't been discovered long. I think I read it in a science magazine maybe two or three years ago—a new organ that science had finally uncovered. And it was because of a laser-type treatment of endoscopy that previously, when they had fixed tissue to look at microscopically, they saw that these collagen sheets and bundles looked fairly flattened and fairly solid in these tissues. But yet when they used these lasers, they saw that these were structural cavities that were filled with fluid. And they call this material, this ground substance, the interstitium. And they now say that this interstitium is a fifth organ and primarily, I think, one of the largest organs in the body. But it's responsible obviously for the metastases of cancer cells.

And in herbal medicine, like I said, the principal herb that I think of is poke root. It's been traditionally used for breast cancer as well as other cancers. It certainly has lymphatic immunostimulant and anti-inflammatory activity. And like I said, it's definitely been used, certainly in Europe, ongoing. And it's been in the herbal pharmacopoeia for many years in the treatment of cancers and specifically for lymphatic cancers and breast cancers.

What do you understand about the interstitium and this so-called ground substance through which I think some of these compounds—I think one, namely the main compound from Phytolacca—is having its activity with. But obviously other agents get into the lymphatics. There's obviously a pathway for many different substances.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Structures have been identified within this previously thought to be amorphous extravascular system. A Korean named Bonghan Kim, I think it was in the 1960s, called it the third circulatory system. And what are now known as the exosomes—a large number of these small vesicles secreted by cells are transported outside the blood vessels, some of them inside the ordinary blood stream. But many of them flow through apparent channels in the extracellular material that seem to be almost specific for carrying the lipid microvesicles or exosomes from a cell under stress to a cell which is, for example, in the bone marrow that can produce repair factors and send it back through the various circulatory systems—lymphatic or the extra lymphatic one identified by the Korean or via the bloodstream itself—to either correct a tumor or in some cases make it worse, depending on the state of the organism.

## First Caller: Flax Oil and Avocados
tags: [[flax-oil]] [[avocados]] [[polyunsaturated-fat]] [[caller-questions]]

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller. Where are you from and what's your question?

**Michael (Engineer):** It was a local person with a bad connection, but they wanted to know what you thought of flax oil and avocados.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Avocados are good enough, very pleasant, nutritious food. But you don't want to eat very large quantities as a regular quantity just because there is some polyunsaturated fat in it. And the flax oil is also very highly polyunsaturated. So the flax meal has a laxative effect, a bulk laxative action. So the flax meal can be protective, anti-cancer, but you don't want to build up a reserve of the polyunsaturated fats found in flax oil.

## Second Caller: Frankincense for Cancer and Zeolite
tags: [[frankincense]] [[boswellia]] [[zeolite]] [[essential-oils]] [[breast-cancer]]

**Caller:** I just wanted to say I have two miraculous stories. I'll start with my own. Quickly, I developed a chest cancer. And I knew it was cancer because it's a cancer of that type. It really feels like a little needle inside of your chest. And I knew exactly what to do. I don't—can't tell you why I knew what to do, but I had ordered from an essential oil company a product called frankincense. And I opened up the clear glass bottle and I liberally put it on my chest. And four hours later, the pain stopped. And I know I had killed the cancer. I just absolutely bathed it in the frankincense. It didn't return ever. It's been 10 years now. That was my story and no one knew about it except me. And I was quite proud of that.

The other was my sister went down to San Francisco to UCSF and the doctors said, you have a cancer. And she was very upset about that, of course, as we would all be as I was as well. And so I said, look, I had used frankincense prior to this time to kill a cancer, start that program. So I went down and I got her some 3 or 4 ounces of frankincense. Now this was older frankincense. It was about maybe six months to a year old, I call it out of date. And I gave that to her and she started doing that.

And now we're just basic people. You know, she has a college degree. I have two years of college. And so I'm talking hopefully on just a level. I'm not a doctor myself. I don't claim to be a physician. I'm just telling you what I have done to be successful. And so I started her on that program of applying it into the area. And I've also used it internally before. And as long as you don't use too much and we're all different. I was also taking it internally for a while, mixing it with some sort of water or juice. And that seems to have cleansed out my system as well.

She started on the program of using the frankincense topically. And she said I had a cyst on the front of my body and started using it. And she said about three months later, that little cyst fell out onto her finger. And she was quite astonished about that. But the other thing that she didn't tell me about that she was using was something called zeolite, Z-E-O-L-I-T-E I believe. And she said that it was taking the heavy metals out of the body and excreting them out. She has been a person that's eaten organically her whole life. She is intolerant, cannot take calcium through dairy products, and she has her own way, she's a vegetarian, she has her own gardens, and she's lived this way her whole life. What do you think of those two things?

**Andrew Murray:** Well, I'm glad you mentioned frankincense. Its name is Boswellia serrata and I was going to mention it—one of many herbs that have been used for cancer, specifically I think for skin cancers. So Boswellia is one that we were going to mention. And then the zeolite sounds like a chelating agent. Dr. Peat, do you know much about zeolite and its use?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I didn't hear all of that. But frankincense and myrrh contain a variety of triterpenes that are structured similarly to the steroids. And they haven't actually been studied enough to define exactly how their anti-cancer effect works.

## Connective Tissue, Calcium, and Inflammation
tags: [[connective-tissue]] [[calcium]] [[inflammation]] [[silica]] [[horsetail]] [[energy-metabolism]]

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, just getting back to the herbal medicine perspective of improving the connective tissue and strengthening the connective tissue—and the interstitium being a pathway, a highway through which fluids move and can either be picked up in the lymphatic, if they are things like bacteria or yeast or fungal spores, et cetera, and trapped and dealt with and neutralized. The cancer is also able to use this same highway to be taken to distant sites. But there definitely is a rationale for improving the connective tissue itself, as cancer cells and cancers locally break down adjacent tissues and invade them in their quest for access to the vasculature or lymphatics.

What do you think about agents that we're familiar with? Things like horsetail, a rich source of silica, or whether it's Phytolacca and the main components of Phytolacca that have this lymphatic immune-stimulating activity? Do you think there's a value in—what do you see as a value in improving and toning the tissues? I know you mentioned a lot about calcium and calcium obviously is part and parcel of improving the extracellular matrix and its homeostasis between being stored in bone and being available in the bloodstream is something you see people get plenty of calcium for.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** And the role of calcium is very closely related to energy metabolism and inflammation. When you're deficient in energy, you activate many of the pro-inflammatory peptides and small lipid molecules. In an ideal situation, that momentary increase of inflammation can reactivate and design repair processes, especially for the connective tissue. But getting the energy and essential nutrients provided is going to have an anti-inflammatory effect which allows the energy production to take effect and maintain structural integrity. And the effect of adequate calcium in your diet is to oppose the excitatory effects of too much phosphate in your diet. So the calcium is having an anti-inflammatory, pro-energy restoration effect. And that has the effect of maintaining structural integrity of the interstitium, the whole structural framework that holds cells together.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Not only anti-cancer, but you're mentioning the benefits it has on maintaining healthy connective tissue as well.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah, keeping inflammation down and energy up.

## Third Caller: Low-Grade Bladder Cancer Treatment
tags: [[bladder-cancer]] [[vitamin-a]] [[proteolytic-enzymes]] [[lidocaine]] [[aspirin]]

**Andrew Murray:** We have a caller. Where are you from and what's your question?

**Caller:** Hi, I'm from Garberville and I had a low-grade bladder cancer and it came back again and they just take it out. But I was wondering if you had any recommendations and I think I'll take my answer on the air.

**Andrew Murray:** Okay, Doctor. Low-grade bladder cancer. What would you suggest as being good approaches? Obviously everything that we had previously talked about, but go ahead and speak to that.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There have been several people developed effective treatments by infusing a mixture of nutrients—vitamin A-related things, proteolytic enzymes, and stabilizing anti-inflammatory things such as I think lidocaine was one of them—into the bladder and then arranging the person's posture so that the mixture is in contact with the actual tumor itself. So you can get a very, very high concentration on the tumor. And several of those procedures have been very effective at removing persistent bladder tumors.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Okay, so let me just repeat that to make sure that we heard you correctly. So you said there's been research done to show that an infusion of proteolytic enzymes, vitamin A compounds, and lidocaine—lidocaine infused with the person laying down in such a way that, you know, whether it was on the back of the bladder wall or the front of the bladder wall, laying on their back or their front? Is that what you mean?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. I'm not sure if that was a complete list of the ingredients, but two or three groups were using very similar groups with a very high cure rate.

**Michael (Engineer):** And what is infusion in this context? Are you putting that up through the urethra or are you drinking?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Filling the bladder with a mixture, half filling it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** All right. And you also said anti-inflammatory things, so maybe like aspirin, maybe. Would they have infused aspirin into the bladder?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I always recommend aspirin for any cancer. It reduces inflammation, helps to restore the energy level, and has at least a dozen effects that help to control or eliminate cancer.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** And sorry, I just wanted to say I would like to put the warning out there that if people are choosing to use aspirin for treating their own cancers and they're doing a home treatment like that, you should really call us and we'll give you the instructions on how to take aspirin safely in conjunction with vitamin K2. It's very important if you're taking more than a baby aspirin a day that you take vitamin K2 to prevent bleeding.

If anyone wants to use aspirin any more than a baby aspirin a day, then email us or call us at our number, which is Western Botanical Medicine, 707-986-9506. And our email is either Andrew or Sarah at westernbotanicalmedicine.com and Sarah is with an H, S-A-R-A-H at westernbotanicalmedicine.com.

## Anti-Coagulation and Cancer Metastasis
tags: [[aspirin]] [[anticoagulation]] [[platelets]] [[metastasis]] [[progesterone]] [[garlic]] [[ginkgo]]

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, how about—I mean, again, aspirin, I think, just as we mentioned it, talking about the coagulopathy that happens with cancer and even if it's not stimulated by estrogen, which promotes blood thickening and clotting and is pro-cancer in its own right. The approach to treatment as anti-coagulopathy treatment in terms of making the platelets less sticky, making blood flow more easily. Do you think this would have a good rational basis in science for using things like aspirin and garlic and things like ginkgo and other things that got traditional use for improving blood flow and preventing clotting?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** The clotting system and the platelets are very central to the ability of the metastatic cells to get across the blood vessel into the area it's going to colonize as metastatic cancer. And various things that decrease the stickiness and the tendency to coagulate of the platelets—several of these substances have been studied and very strongly discourage metastatic spread and so increase the survival rate. Lidocaine, aspirin, and progesterone are just three of the factors that have been over and over demonstrated to interfere with the metastatic stickiness and ability to travel in the cancer cells. It makes them stay home and not hurt anything.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Stay home, cancer, stay home.

## Watchful Waiting and Cancer Statistics
tags: [[watchful-waiting]] [[prostate-cancer]] [[cancer-treatment]] [[mortality]] [[autopsy-findings]]

**Andrew Murray:** My next question—anti-angiogenic activity to manage cancer. A little bit like diabetes, because diabetes has been implicated in the breakdown of vascular walls.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** There were studies in the 1940s and 1950s showing that the longer people left their cancer untreated, the longer they lived. And several studies have looked at the statistics on the population in general showing that the more you treat in some cancers, the survival rate stays the same no matter how much you do to the patient. But in some cases, the more you treat, the higher the death rate is.

That was first seen distinctly in the case of prostate cancer in the early 1990s. And by the end of the century, this had impressed enough prostate specialists that they came up with the idea of watchful waiting, figuring that if you don't use any of the harmful treatments such as high-dose estrogen to treat prostate cancer and just watch what's happening, don't do multiple biopsies and so on. But the normal aging process happens faster than the development of a normal old man's prostate cancer. And that's a well-established concept now that watchful waiting has actually improved the mortality rate from cancer by failing to treat it.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Well, what's that statistic you quote, Dr. Peat? That 99% or 99.9% of people over the age of 50 have some form of abdominal cancer. 99.9% of people will not die of cancer.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In an autopsy, you can find cancer essentially in 100% of the people over 50 if you look for it. It's part of a natural healing process and most people just coexist with many of these little cancers that aren't really hurting anything.

**Andrew Murray:** I think on a very quick side note, just for people to help people if they want to try this themselves—I don't generally advocate self-treatment. But on a very small side note, I had a keratosis, what I thought was a keratosis on the side of my nose. And I spoke to you about this, Dr. Peat, three or four years ago. I had it for two years. It obviously wasn't healthy cells, it was unhealthy cells.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** In your latest photograph, your nose looks fine. No defect at all.

**Andrew Murray:** I just wanted to tell people that I had it. Fortunately or unfortunately, I did have a biopsy done and it identified it as basal cell carcinoma. And of course they wanted to do everything with it, which I refused. I went ahead and did what you suggested I do. I don't have it anymore. I mean, folks, it's possible.

## Closing Remarks
tags: [[robert-kennedy]] [[anthony-fauci]] [[free-speech]] [[show-info]]

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Anyway, before we end, I want to mention a book that I think might be the most important book published in the last two or three years just came out. It's Robert Kennedy Jr.'s *The Real Anthony Fauci*. It gives us a background for not only the COVID-19 process, but the background going back decades.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, well, he's been there, isn't he, for 40 years or something. He's pretty entrenched. Dr. Fauci is pretty entrenched.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Yeah. But this book I think is going to change that.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, they said that possibly he's perjured himself. But anyway, thanks so much for your time. Dr. Peat, it's five to the hour and I know the engineer wants to wrap it up and we need to give people your information. So thanks so much for joining us.

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** Okay, thank you.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thank you, Dr. Peat. Good night.

**Andrew Murray:** For those people who've listened to the show before or who just tuned in, Dr. Raymond Peat's got a wealth of experience. He's been doing this over 40 years. He's written several books. He's published hundreds of articles. He's a very altruistic character, as most people who know him can attest. His website is raypeat.com, R-A-Y-P-E-A-T.com, and so his journal articles there are well referenced. He's a very scientific person. He doesn't believe in hocus pocus and crystal dangling and whatever else. I'm sorry to offend some people who maybe use crystals. I'm not saying they don't work or do anything, but it's generally a do less than do something proactive situation.

So we can be contacted Monday through Friday at westernbotanicalmedicine.com. Until the December version, we will look forward to seeing you, hearing from you, answering questions, give us feedback, and thanks so much for your time.

**Sarah Johanneson Murray:** Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving and thanks for tuning in. My name is Sarah Murray.

**Andrew Murray:** My name is Andrew Murray. Good night.
