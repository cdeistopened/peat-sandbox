## Introduction

**Andrew Murray:** Welcome to this month's Ask Your Herb Doctor, the August 21, 2020 edition. My name is Andrew Murray.

**Sarah Murray:** My name is Sarah Murray. Welcome to the show.

**Andrew Murray:** Every third Friday of the month from 7 to 8 o'clock, we present an hour's radio show based on alternative medicines and different ideas—not to look at newfangled treatments, but to look at some of the empirically tried and tested medicines and herbal medicines. Sarah and I are both qualified medical herbalists and we've been working with herbal medicine for 20 plus years, manufacturing herbal medicines for distribution up and down the west coast of the States.

We're very pleased to have Dr. Raymond Peat join us again. The KMUD.org website archives these shows, but they only host them for about two months before removing them. If you want to download the show, go to the audio archive section and scroll through Friday Night Talk (the 7-8pm slot), look for the third Friday of every month, and you'll find Ask Your Herb Doctor. We also have 10 years of shows available on our website at westernbotanicalmedicine.com under the Resources tab—everything from 2009 to the present.

Dr. Peat, as always, I'd like you to introduce yourself for those who haven't heard you before. Could you explain your academic and professional background?

**Dr. Raymond Peat:** I studied for a PhD in biology specializing in reproductive physiology at the University of Oregon from 1968 to 1972. My thesis focused on the oxidative changes with aging. Before that, I was studying various things in the humanities—literature, linguistics, psychology, and philosophy—and I started a college in Mexico where I worked for several years.

**Andrew Murray:** You've written extensively and published books, and you produce a newsletter that's regularly distributed. I believe it's bimonthly. For those interested in exploring more of Dr. Peat's work and background, you can find all his articles and publications at www.raypeat.com.

## Pandemic Policy and Mortality Data

**Andrew Murray:** Dr. Peat, last month and for several months now we've been following the COVID situation worldwide. In all the wealth of information available, we're trying to sift reality from misinformation. Our objective is to provide factual information with the philosophy of first do no harm. I wanted to discuss the document Codex Alimentarius, which we've covered before. It was first brought to my attention in 2003 by Dr. Rima Laibow. This document outlines a systematic plan to unify and "harmonize" everything, removing individuality and identity extensively.

I also saw an interesting video from Harry Vox filmed in 2014, where he clearly explains the Rockefeller Foundation's 2010 publication "Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development." This document describes something called "lockstep"—governments initiating and supporting top-down control with authoritarian leadership interventions. It praises China's control of populations and mentions bringing prior outbreaks like SARS, H5N1, and avian bird flu under control through authoritarian government control.

We live in a free speech society blessed with inalienable rights—life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These directly conflict with authoritarianism. I'm not being political here, just exploring facts. Mainstream media has become at odds with science, which seeks to understand self-evident truth. Those who give up freedom for security get neither. Are you familiar with Codex Alimentarius and Kissinger's memorandum about population control?

**Dr. Peat:** About 50 years ago, the Club of Rome was a group of influential people sketching out what the world would need to do. I've been following this ideology, which I think has gathered up all the dangerous and degrading ideas in our culture and is presenting them as the best alternatives to problems that are being created by the very operation of that system.

In the 2010 Rockefeller Report, they present four scenarios of possible futures. Lockstep is only one of them—the others describe various future disasters. But the horrifying thing is that in each scenario, digital technology is presented as the only redeeming possibility. They won't consider any future that isn't dependent on digital technology as the savior. I think that's at the very heart of what's been going on for at least 80 years—the herding together of all culture, humanities, and sciences. A few people in the humanities put up resistance for 20 or 30 years, but those people have pretty much died off. The science community has been so indoctrinated with the lockstep mentality that if you get through the university and can be called a scientist, you're expected to follow the rules that are set. They're looking forward to this digital lockstep society.

**Sarah Murray:** Is that so they can feed us information they want us to have, or are they saying it's for the benefit of underprivileged people who can then access information?

**Dr. Peat:** The only real alternative is if we had a post office where you could send letters with confidence. But the only workable alternative to being controlled from above is to actually get together—have teachers and students, people in clubs doing things they're interested in. A whole network of people doing interesting things is a real alternative society. People would start reforming things from the bottom up if they could actually get together. But the whole drift has been away from factory work where people could get together on breaks and talk. They've been pushing people into cubicles or even working at home on computers so that they don't talk to each other.

**Andrew Murray:** That's exactly what's happening with the social distancing terminology and enforcement. It's literally divide and conquer.

**Dr. Peat:** The digital system is at the point where they did an experiment in India abolishing paper money and coin, and lots of people starved because they didn't have access to bank accounts. That was just a few years ago. But now they're saying that money transfers—supposedly viruses—have to be abolished for public health. This means banks will do everything and money will be banned except through the digital bank-controlled system. At that point, you'll likely have to pay interest on your money because the bank will be doing all the work of paying your debts and salary. So naturally they'll earn a commission, and savings will be at the mercy of the banks.

**Andrew Murray:** It's completely backwards from how our societies have functioned. The whole cashless society goal sounds interesting from the perspective of removing cash from drug cartels and controlling crime, which thrives on untraceable cash. But there's an abhorrence feeling behind the cashless digital society because, spiritually speaking, part and parcel of humanity is the spirit within the person. We're all created beings with the capacity for thought, emotion, compassion—and we're created. That creation is something like art and music—it's an expression of the soul. The whole digital scenario, like the Matrix, is far from living a spiritual life in harmony with the world we live in. A cashless society is just the next step, and if they want to start charging money to hold your money by charging interest, that's an incredible income-generating system.

**Dr. Peat:** Once students get used to getting lessons on their computer, the best lessons will be from the best teachers. They can record those and give them to everyone. This means all the rest of the teachers are unnecessary and will be replaced by recorded elite lectures. The digital virtual reality programs will be designed expensively, so everyone will have access to complex virtual reality explanations. But they'll be so expensive that only a couple of corporations will be competent to make the really good ones. So digital corporations will be put in a position of power. A chief executive recently summed up her view: "Humans are biohazards, machines aren't."

**Andrew Murray:** Elon Musk, for example, wants to bring humans to Mars and recolonize planets. He's also very much behind merging AI with our brains and having chips implanted to make us more than we are through science.

**Dr. Peat:** The CIA started working on those projects around 1950—making remote-controlled dogs, for example. I knew a woman who was officially diagnosed with paranoia and had some really horrible fantasies, but she didn't have any fantasies to compare with the reality of what they've been working on.

**Andrew Murray:** Getting back to the authoritarian nature portrayed worldwide—Europe is becoming embroiled, willingly or not, through governments and leaders who are conspiring or are interested financially about partnerships. You've mentioned the Silk Road and China's expansion to the west. There's nothing new about countries trading and dominating—England did it, other countries did it. But China's expansion militarily, economically, and their supposed control of COVID-19 for what it's worth—let's get into some recent articles.

I just saw a post of hundreds of people in Wuhan swimming in a pool, completely next to each other arm to arm, no face masks, swimming like it's the middle of summer and everything's great. But apparently they had the best control of their population, suffered the least casualties, and got on top of COVID-19. I can't help but think this is another rollout, a kind of dog training event for people to get the impression that authoritarian leadership is the only way forward.

Josh Mitteldorf wrote an article in July 2020 called "Politics Influences the Science of COVID-19" published in Nature. He clearly outlines that social distancing is very questionable and doesn't really alter the numbers. He's also saying that the reported numbers have been conflated out of all proportion. The actual numbers are nowhere near what's being reported.

To put this in perspective: cardiac disease causes 600,000 deaths a year in the US, and cancer causes about 600,000 as well. So perspective is the most important thing. We can't use statistics to conflate an idea that's being put forward in an article.

Dr. Peat, what do you interpret as happening with the actual figures at this point in time?

**Dr. Peat:** The political action has been almost entirely based on a mathematical model from a group at Imperial College in London, delivered to the government on March 16. They predicted several million deaths if there wasn't a lockdown. This group, led by Neil Ferguson, published an article in Nature magazine pushing the same absolutely discredited mathematical model, saying that because several million people didn't die after lockdown, the lockdown prevented millions of deaths. They're neglecting that the influenza season drops off in spring and summer. The curve is exactly like that when you look at total deaths in the United States week by week.

The CDC has detailed records going back for years. I looked at them recently, and they show a continuous decline. COVID deaths declined to a low point in June, but total US weekly deaths have declined steadily since mid-May. All mortality is declining. There was a slight upturn in deaths diagnosed as COVID, but when total mortality is decreasing, that can be explained because people have been instructed to include any suspicious death as a COVID death.

I can't take their word for it. Just recently I looked back at their figures from February 1st. Several other people and I had commented that they were showing a historically low rate of death starting January 1st. Then those missing deaths popped up in the April COVID mortality peak. Just recently, the numbers going back 25 weeks were revised upward. Reports coming in from all over the United States starting January 1st somehow showed that people were underreporting by coincidence from every part of the country. Previously, the CDC finalized their figures by the third week, usually mostly by the second week. After the third week, the numbers had been stationary year after year. But just recently, they looked back 25 weeks and changed these numbers reported from all over the US. It's one falsification on top of another one.

**Sarah Murray:** So what you're saying is that if you look at this year's total deaths compared to previous years, they're not any higher overall.

**Dr. Peat:** When I and several other people looked at them in February, March, and April, they were below historical weekly averages. Something had happened to the death rate. It was definitely collapsing by 5 to 10% every week starting on January 1st.

**Sarah Murray:** And there was a historical high in April all of a sudden.

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah, convenient. If you had been skimming off reported deaths and saving them up, they would just about make that peak. But then just about a week ago I looked back at those same supposedly identical numbers, and they didn't comment at all. But I looked at the numbers I had written down in March and looked at the same list now posted, and they have revised 25 weeks backwards so that my list now shows the deficit that had been there. Now they show what looks like normal mortality rate. Other people notice that I haven't heard any comments on this revision, which I think is even more shocking that they haven't commented. They always left the numbers in place. After about the third week, no more information was coming in. Now suddenly they were flooded with thousands and thousands of deaths going back 25 weeks.

**Sarah Murray:** So does that mean they just added a bunch of deaths into the January, February, and March numbers?

**Dr. Peat:** I think it's obvious that they're just skimming and making up numbers, putting numbers back that look plausible.

**Sarah Murray:** So if all-cause mortality means you're comparing deaths from any cause, and comparing January to August this year with 2019 and 2018—in those previous years, people died from the flu. This year, people are also dying from the flu. So what you're trying to say is there's absolutely no difference this year compared to previous years when you look at the hard data, even if you can't trust it?

**Dr. Peat:** Yeah. And with the great peak of COVID-19 in April, there was a simultaneous crash in mortality from the flu. Deborah Birx at the CDC commented that things that were not really COVID were being put down as COVID—incorrect diagnosis. And she disappeared from public view right after she said that.

**Sarah Murray:** I heard her say in a press conference that she estimates about 25% of COVID deaths are not really COVID deaths; they're other flus. The press was asking, "Where did influenza A and influenza B go?" And she said, "Well, probably 25% of COVID deaths are other flus."

**Dr. Peat:** But by their own numbers, you see the straight line down of influenza deaths and the straight line up of COVID deaths. Denny Rancourt, in a video, plotted a graph from the CDC's own numbers showing an absolutely impossible curve of mortality—a crash that's impossible in any natural way. He says it should be prosecuted as a crime.

## The Great Reset and Economic Restructuring

**Sarah Murray:** Okay, so just assume they're playing with the numbers because the numbers are going up and down and all-cause mortality is not changing. So what do you think, Dr. Peat? What's their end game? Why is the CDC doing this? What are they wanting?

**Dr. Peat:** Klaus Schwab, when he announced the January meeting of the World Economic Forum a few months ago, called it the Great Reset. He said that planetary warming was working fine towards their goal but very slowly. Now the virus is going to allow it to happen very quickly. Their goal is to shut down the old economy so it has to be replaced by online digital substitutes. They're replacing thousands of retailers across the country with places like Amazon. And incidentally, Jeff Bezos's wealth increased by $25 billion in just a few weeks.

## Displacement and the Future of Work

tags: [[automation]] [[unemployment]] [[digital-robots]] [[labor]]

**Sarah Murray:** So the end game is so that they can consolidate power and control global warming?

**Andrew Murray:** Well, I mean, I want to get to the point here. Collapsing economies and rebuilding them by the IMF—the International Monetary Fund—is nothing new. The World Bank does the same thing. The countries that are rebuilt tend to be rebuilt along a socialist authoritarian model. From my own birth country in England, the European Union is one of these alliances more closely tied to China than ever before.

**Dr. Peat:** Even Hitler was making allowance for the German people surviving. But that isn't in the present program. When you have hundreds of millions of people displaced by digital robots, what are you going to do with hundreds of millions of unemployed people? They'll be expensive to support. They aren't going to get first-rate care in any system that I can foresee. The idle workers—no one has explained how they're going to be disposed of.

**Sarah Murray:** Okay, but what about the IRS? Wouldn't they be upset if hundreds of millions of people were unemployed and not paying their taxes?

**Dr. Peat:** A lot of them will probably be unemployed too.

## COVID Treatment and Ventilators

**Andrew Murray:** The virus does exist, but treatment has changed. And if we can get your response. Dr. Peat, I mentioned that the numbers had been skewed and they're actually lower than normal numbers. Perhaps the two people I brought out two months ago—Erin Marie Olzewski, a nurse who was whistleblowing about fatalities from ventilators, and Dr. Kyle Seidel, the New York ER doctor who was saying that ventilators were doing all the damage. This wasn't like any other sudden acute respiratory disease. People were just dying on ventilators. New York had some of the highest fatalities. I think the changing nature of intervention is playing a part. I'm not saying COVID-19 doesn't exist—it does. But we're saying it's nowhere near the world problem we want to be put in place and dominated over. The numbers just don't line up. Treatment has changed fairly drastically. I know several doctors and a surgeon in Los Angeles who are using hydroxychloroquine and losartan very effectively for recovering patients who are in any kind of acute pulmonary distress with a positive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-19.

**Dr. Peat:** The thing that Kyle Seidel and one other doctor in Brooklyn pointed out was that they were treating them in exactly the wrong way. They had the classical symptoms of high altitude sickness, which is basically a carbon dioxide deficit. And if you pump oxygen into their lungs, you kill them as fast as anything. Gradually, over several weeks, the whole establishment started catching on in a slow, reluctant way. But basically they've stopped murdering thousands of people by stuffing tubes in when they should be giving them a little extra carbon dioxide with their respiratory oxygen without forcing it in.

## Oxygen Saturation and Physiology

tags: [[oxygen-saturation]] [[carbon-dioxide]] [[physiology]] [[breathing-mechanics]]

**Caller:** I'm calling from Redway and I wanted to know about hyperbaric chambers. I've heard that people are using high pressure chamber treatment which might link in with the symptoms of high altitude sickness.

**Andrew Murray:** Yeah, we've discussed this a couple of months back and I think hyperbaric was on the list of relatively safe and relatively effective. What do you think, Dr. Pete?

**Dr. Peat:** The problem of carbon dioxide when you're having poisoning leading to sepsis and inflammation of the lungs—the classical thing—is like these COVID symptoms or high altitude sickness. The carbon dioxide can escape through the damaged lung, but you can't get oxygen in. The inflammation of the infected intestine and other tissues produces sepsis, producing lactic acid, which drives off the carbon dioxide. And that blocks the urge to breathe when you're deficient in carbon dioxide. People didn't seem to be lacking oxygen by their symptoms—they didn't feel a great need to breathe, which they should have been, because their oxygen was actually getting low. But that happens when you can't get the production of carbon dioxide because lactic acid is being produced instead. If you can get oxygen in through the skin or intestine or other ways than the lungs, that could save them. But adding some carbon dioxide to the system is the only way you're going to get their physiological urge to breathe properly.

**Andrew Murray:** Let me quickly ask you this, Dr. Pete, before we give out your information. In hospital, when you get hooked up, they monitor your pulse and your heart rate on an ECG, and then they look at your O2 saturations. They always talk about 99 and 98 as being great. And some of these patients with COVID are down to 40s and 50s. I know you don't agree with the high percentage oxygen saturation because you are, in a lot of ways and very likely through science, against oxygen per se, but you always counter that with the saving grace of carbon dioxide. What do you think is a healthy person's oxygen saturation should be, and at what point should you begin to take note that it's low?

**Dr. Peat:** I've noticed for years that when I'm comfortable, mine is in the low 90s, but if I go run up a hill, my oxygen will go up to 96 to 100. When I'm really using a lot of oxygen, my oxygen saturation goes up several percent. I tried warming or cooling my hand, and I found that cooling my hand would produce a very high saturation because my hand was not consuming any oxygen—it was effectively a metabolically dead hand. And warming my hand up to body temperature, it starts burning oxygen and holds the level down to 94, something like that.
