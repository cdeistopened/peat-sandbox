## Transcript

[Speaker A]: 53 degrees outside 7pm Kmud Garberville, Kmue, Eureka K L A I Laytonville. Where the views and opinions expressed throughout the broadcast day are those of the speaker and not necessarily the station staff, underwriters or volunteers. Sometimes it's not even the speaker's point of view. They're possibly trolling you, but more likely they're just trying to express somebody else's point of view so that you can more completely understand the issue at hand. So don't get mad. Just give your information out too.

[Speaker B]: Sam Sa. Sam Sa.

[Speaker A]: And I believe I have the herb doctor here.

[Speaker C]: Hey, good evening.

[Speaker A]: Good evening. And we have Dr. Pete. I'm sorry that took so long. Take it away.

[Speaker C]: No problem. Welcome to this month's ask your herb doctor. The see here, November 19th edition, 2021. My name is Andrew Murray.

[Speaker D]: My name is Sarah Johanneson Murray. Welcome to our show, Ask your herb Doctor.

[Speaker C]: For those of you who just joined us or have never heard the show before, it runs every third Friday of the month from 7 till 8pm we have a call in, a live call in from 7:30 until the close of the show. At 8:00 o', clock, people are invited to call in with any questions related to the topic that we're discussing. As has become very customary now, Dr. Pete is our guest and joining us to share his knowledge. Last month in October, we opened up a discussion which we couldn't finish in a month, and it was concerning metabolic defects in cancer and also the approach to cancer, the strategies or alternative approaches to cancer. And Dr. Pete has for 35, 40 years been researching and working in alternative medicine, approaches to physiology, and has a website with a wealth of information that we'll be giving out towards the end of the show. So let me just see if Dr. Pete is with us and go from there. Dr. Pete, you with us?

[Speaker B]: Yes. I can just barely hear you.

[Speaker C]: Okay. I wonder if you have a volume. Do you have a volume setting on your phone?

[Speaker B]: A tinny quality? It isn't the volume. It's a blurry, tinny quality.

[Speaker A]: Yeah, you guys sound like you're on a speakerphone or something. Maybe you're just not the best connection. I think it's okay if callers don't think so. They'll pipe up though.

[Speaker C]: Let me just ask both of you if this is any clearer now. Did you, either of you hear that better?

[Speaker A]: I heard a click and I think it got better. But I was also switching from one thing to another here, but I think that is a little better.

[Speaker C]: Yeah. Dr. P, did you hear that any better?

[Speaker B]: I can hear you, but not the engineer. Oh, yeah.

[Speaker A]: I think that aspect. That's an aspect of our board, I think. But he doesn't need to hear me. You guys are the important ones.

[Speaker B]: Yeah.

[Speaker C]: Okay. At this point, I'm not too sure Sarah can hear us. That's the only thing. Well, I think we probably just better carry on this way then. And just sometime during Dr. Pete's explanation of some of the questioning we'll be going through to tonight, we perhaps can get Sarah on and she can be part of that. Otherwise. Okay. So, Dr. Pete, thanks so much for giving your time again this month. Would you just let people know more about you from an academic research perspective and then we can carry on the show? Okay.

[Speaker B]: In the 60s, I was studying various subjects in the humanities, and I decided to go into biology to study the brain mainly. But when I got to graduate School in 1968, my interest went to aging and its influence on the metabolism of largely the reproductive process, how reproduction influences the general process of aging. And since then, I've been following up the same general topics. Aging, stress, sickness, and especially how the hormones, reproductive hormones, can accelerate or retard the process of aging. Okay.

[Speaker C]: So in terms of a hormonal physiology for aging, that's been a specialism. I know you've worked in many other related branches of that surrounding natural healthcare. Last month we opened up a kind of discussion on the alternative approaches to cancer with an emphasis on the metabolic defects, which you have fairly set principles that you have uncovered over time, some of which obviously don't line up with kind of regular medicine. I know you have a very alternative perspective towards treating people. And I think I'm right in saying that the first do no harm rationale would be something you hold quite closely. Modern cancer therapy and chemotherapy and radiotherapy. I don't think these are modalities of which you are at all in favor of. But that's a very personal choice that each patient who's going through cancer therapy has to come up against. But obviously going through herbal medicine and alternative medicines, most people perhaps looking for alternatives and not looking at conventional treatment. Anyway. Last month we covered cellular mitochondrial activity and how that produces energy. We discussed the myth of sugar being cancer promoting, which is fairly rife in the mainstream. It seems to be repeated almost daily, that sugar's something to be avoided for almost everything. And you've dispelled that myth for sure. Then the kind of neuroendocrine dysregulation you mentioned, things like estrogen driving not only breast, but other cancers and then the, what they call the kind of hypothalamic pituitary access axis where stress produces cortisol and through chronic stress the immune system can suffer. And how this is all part and parcel of a kind of weakened organism that does in some ways predispose to the lack of surveillance. So the last thing I think we got to was looking at Radox balancing and mentioning that the flavonoids, a fairly diverse group of plant products in many, many different areas, can be used to quench free radical damage, which is part and parcel also of cancer in its own right. I had some abstracts that got my interest. I know you're a, a big proponent of saturated fats and you do not at all adhere to polyunsaturates as being in any way healthy or beneficial for the organism. And actually very much destruction and inflammation is caused by them. So the abstracts I was looking at were things like lipidation, which we have talked about many different shows at many different times. And this peroxidation and byproducts of lipid metabolism or lipid oxidation is what happens. These have been things that have been shown to promote cancer. So the whole rationale of people using these omega 3s and 6s and fish oils as being quote unquote healthy is absolutely not what you want to be using if you've got a cancer diagnosis or even if you don't have a cancer diagnosis. How about that? Yeah.

[Speaker B]: A couple of the abstracts you're referring to I think mentioned that on a high fish oil diet, the Metastasis was about 1,000 times worse than on a low fat diet or even a fat fish in diet. Just a huge difference from supplementing fish oil versus not having fat. And we can make all of the unsaturated and saturated fats that we need from carbohydrates. So we don't really need any fats in the diet except for the pleasant taste and helping to absorb other nutrients. These abstracts in particular show the tremendous pro metastatic effect of the fish oil fats.

[Speaker C]: I saw the other references, particularly for liver metastases and cancer growth in the liver. Obviously the liver is one of the major organs blood flows through. And so vascular borne cancers that travel to different sites through the vasculature can certainly become picked up in the liver and the liver itself, because it's a kind of sinusoidal organ like a sponge, if you'd like a matrix of very many capillaries and openings and ducts and places where cancers can settle and Grow are quite often seen in cancer as a secondary spread to the liver. The other articles here that I saw said that these omega 3s in particular, I think the sixes were probably also implicated, but the Omega 3s promoted cancer metastasis to the liver. And again, there was a direct causal relationship between these omega 3s and liver metastases.

[Speaker B]: Dr. P. Yes?

[Speaker D]: Can you hear me okay?

[Speaker B]: Yes.

[Speaker D]: So this lipid peroxidation or rancid fat, that or we, when we eat fat, it can go rancid if it's not saturated. And that's known as lipid peroxidation. That applies to not only the fish oils, but also like all the vegetable seed oils. Right. Like the canola and the soy and all the vegetable oils.

[Speaker B]: The more highly unsaturated they are, the quicker they break down. And some of the oxidative breakdown is almost immediately. Just as soon as it gets absorbed from your intestine and shows up in your bloodstream, you can find the highly oxidized breakdown fragments of the polyunsaturated fats like fish oil.

[Speaker D]: Wow. Did I hear you correctly stating that metastasis is 1000 times worse in a fatty diet versus a non fat diet?

[Speaker B]: A couple of these studies found that the number and quantity of identifiable metastatic cancer was in these cases, 1,000 times higher.

[Speaker C]: And this would again lead to. Yeah, people that have talked about ketogenic diets, this is absolutely the last thing you want to be doing, right?

[Speaker B]: Yeah. And in the process of getting the ketogenic effect, basically it's starvation and stress that turns on the so called ketone production. But actually the so called ketone bodies, one of the major ketone bodies is actually not a ketone, but an alcohol hydroxyl group as a potential ketone. But in the hydroxyl state which is formed during the ketogenic diet, this becomes a reductant having effect similar to lactic acid, which is a trigger to shift oxidation towards the fermentation or the lactic acid metabolism typical of cancer. And once anything interferes with your ability to oxidize glucose fully, that liberates any stored fatty acids you have in your tissues. And everyone has an abundance of fat mixed right into their functioning tissues. And in the ketogenic state, you are releasing free fatty acids into the bloodstream. And all of the liberated free fatty acids that have been studied promote metastasis. It isn't just the extremely toxic fish oil type, but just the fact that of being a fatty acid rather than a sugar. There's many years Ago, someone named Randall noticed that if you increase the fat in your diet and it turns into free fatty acids, the free fatty acids block the particular enzyme of pyrufate dehydrogenase, which lets us oxidize glucose all the way to carbon dioxide. And the free fatty acids directly activate the enzyme that knocks out our ability to oxidize glucose. And so once you get ketogenic from some degree of starvation, then you're poisoning your ability to fully oxidize glucose. That leaves it producing lactic acid. And when the pyruvate dehydrogenase is poisoned by various things, but especially free fatty acids, then you shift over to the cancer metabolism, producing lactic acid, which shifts the metabolism of other cells in the same direction.

[Speaker D]: So would that apply to saturated fat, but at a lesser extent?

[Speaker B]: Yeah, in some cases, certain saturated fats don't do that at all. But on average, whenever it's been studied, the Randall effect works as soon as our glucose oxidation is interfered with by rising free fatty acids.

[Speaker D]: Right. So this isn't really alternative medicine because this is scientifically backed and researched information that Dr. Peet is sharing with us tonight that might not be applied in orthodox medical treatment of cancer, but this is in no way on the fringe of science. This is scientific information.

[Speaker B]: Yeah. It actually represents 60, more than 60 years investigating what is actually happening in the metabolism of stress and cancer. And the whole thing that has developed in the last 50 years of saying that cancer eats sugar. Cancer lives on sugar. Therefore, if you stop eating sugar, you'll start with cancer. That's absolutely 100% wrong. Sugar starvation does is cause the Randall cycle to take effect, blocking your ability to oxidize sugar fully. So you oxidize, you fermented, producing lactic acid, which promotes more of the cancer metabolism and creates inflammation and brings up the cortisol, stress hormones that break down proteins to make more of the glucose or amino acids which will feed the cancer. The fatty acids themselves are good food for the cancer, but at a certain point of wasting away from cancer, fatty acids aren't very abundant in the body. And so the lactic acid metabolism is maintained by turning body proteins into glucose and amino acids to support the lactic acid metabolism of cancer.

[Speaker D]: So in general, when you consult with people that might have cancer, would you recommend them to eat then a non fat or very low fat diet and a very high sucrose and fructose diet?

[Speaker B]: Yeah. Carbohydrates in general, especially sucrose.

[Speaker D]: Which is sugar, folks. And honey and sugar are chemically identical.

[Speaker B]: Yeah, I think it was last month I mentioned the grape diet. It was famous in the 40s and 50s. It was a very high glucose and sucrose diet combined with a very high intake of the anti inflammatory flavonoids. But those are two of the very important anti cancer agents, the anti inflammatory component of the diet that you get in fruits and vegetables and then the abundance of the minerals and other nutrients of fruit, but an abundance of sucrose so that you don't recur, don't resort to any tendency to liberate fatty acids.

[Speaker C]: Okay. You're listening to ask your herb. Dr. Kmud, 91.1 FM from 7:30 to the end of the show. Callers are welcome to call in with questions related to this month's continuing topic, cancer and cancer alternatives. Again, a number if you're outside or even in the area. 707-923-3911. Our guest speaker, Dr. Raymond Peat. Dr. Pete I wanted to, I wanted to question you about something that from a herbal medicine perspective is very important.

[Speaker B]: For.

[Speaker C]: Basically as an anti cancer strategy as well as recognizing the actual function and value of the lymphatics. I know in breast cancer, lymph nodes obviously become congested. They pick up cancer cells, they are treating them. They are primarily white cells, surveillance sites with other cells that are killer cells, et cetera. They're doing some kind of routine surveillance of all of the fluids that are constantly passing through them. But I wanted to get to the point of a few years ago. Now it hasn't been discovered long. I think I read it in a science magazine maybe two or three years ago, a new organ that science had finally uncovered. And it was because of a laser type treatment of endoscopy that previously when they had fixed tissue to look at microscopy microscopically, they saw that these collagen sheets and bundles looked fairly flattened and fairly solid in these tissues. But yet when they used these lasers, they saw that these were structural cavities that were filled with fluid. And they call this material, this ground substance, the interstitium. And they now say that this interstitium is a fifth organ and primarily, I think, one of the largest organ in the body. But it's responsible obviously for the metastases of cancer cells. And in herbal medicine, like I said, the principal herb that I think of is poke root. It's been traditionally used for breast cancer as well as other cancers. Certainly has lymphatic immunostimulant anti inflammatory activity. And like I said, it's definitely been used certainly in Europe ongoing. And it's been in the herbal pharmacopoeia for many years in the treatment of cancers and specifically for lymphatic cancers and breast cancers.

[Speaker B]: But.

[Speaker C]: What do you understand about the interstitium and this so called ground substance through which I think some of these compounds, I think one, namely the main compound from Phytolaca is having its activity with. But obviously other agents get into the lymphatics. There's obviously a pathway for many different substances.

[Speaker B]: Structures have been identified within this previously thought to be amorphous extravascular system. A Korean named Bangun Kim, I think it was in the 1960s, called it the third circulatory system and what are now known as the exosomes. A large number of these small vesicles secreted by cells are transported outside the blood vessels, some of them inside the ordinary blood stream. But many of them flow through apparent channels in the extracellular material that seem to be almost specific for carrying the lipid, the microvesicles or exosomes from a cell under stress to a cell which is, for example, in the bone marrow that can produce repair factors and send it back through the various circulatory systems lymphatic or the extra lymphatic one identified by the Korean or via the bloodstream itself to either correct a tumor or in some cases make it worse, depending on the state of the organism.

[Speaker A]: And we have a couple callers.

[Speaker C]: Okay, we're good, let's hold that there. Just got into the subject of connective tissue health, which I was going to take the direction of this next subject, but let's take this first caller. Caller, you're on the air. Where are you from and what's your question?

[Speaker A]: It was a local person who was a very bad connection. But I was able to they very simple. They wanted to know what you thought of flax oil and what you thought of avocados.

[Speaker C]: Dr. Pete.

[Speaker B]: Avocados are good enough, very pleasant, nutritious food. But you don't want to eat very large quantities as a regular quantity just because there is some unsaturated polyunsaturated fat in it. And the flax oil is also very highly polyunsaturated. So the flax meal has a laxative effect, a bulk laxative action. So the flax meal can be protective anti cancer, but you don't want to build up a reserve of the polyunsaturated fats found in flax oil.

[Speaker A]: And here's your next caller.

[Speaker E]: Okay, where are you from? His friend? I just wanted to say I have two Miraculous stories. I'll start with my own. Quickly, I developed a chest cancer. And I knew it was cancer because it's a cancer of that type. It really feels like a little needle inside of your chest. And I knew exactly what to do. I don't. Can't tell you why I knew what to do, but I had had ordered from a essential oil company, a product called frankincense. And I opened up the clear glass bottle and I liberally put it on my chest. And in four hours later, the pain stopped. And I know how I had killed the cancer. I just absolutely bathed it in the frankincense. It didn't return ever. It's been 10 years now. That was my story and no one knew about it except me. And I was quite proud of that. The other was my sister went down to San Francisco to ucsf and she was the. The doctors said, you have a cancer. And she was very upset about that, of course, as we would all be as I was as well. And so I said, look, I had used frankincense prior to this time to kill a cancer, start that program. So I went down and I got her some 3 or 4 ounces of frankincense. Now this was older frankincense. It was about maybe six months to a year old, I call it out of date. And I gave that to. And she started doing that. And now we're just basic people. You know, she has a college degree. I have two years of college. And so I'm talking hopefully on just a level. I'm not a doctor myself. I don't claim to be a physician. I'm just telling you what I have done to be successful. And so I started her on that program of applying it into the area. And I've also used it internally before. And as long as you don't use too much and we're all different. I was also taking it internally for a while, mixing it with, with like a. Some sort of water or juice. And that seems to have cleansed out my system as well. She started on the program of using the frankincense topically. And she said I had a cyst on the front of front of my body and started using it. And she said about three months later, that little cyst fell out onto her finger. And she was quite astonished about that. But the other thing that she didn't tell me about that, which she was using was something called zeolite and Z E O L I T E I believe. And she said that it was taking the heavy metals out of the body and excreting them out. She has been a person that's eaten organically her whole life. She is intolerant, cannot take calcium through dairy products, and she has her own way, she's a vegetarian, she has her own gardens, and she's lived this way her whole life. What do you think of those two things?

[Speaker C]: Right, okay. Well, I'm glad you mentioned frankincense and her name is Boswellia sacrat and I was going to mention it. One of many herbs that have been used for cancer, specifically I think for skin cancers. So boswellia is one of that we were going to mention. And then the zeolite sounds like a chelating agent. Dr. Pete, do you know much about zeolite and its use?

[Speaker B]: I didn't hear all of that. But frankincense and myrrh container, a variety of triterpenes that are structured similarly to the steroids. And they haven't actually been studied enough to define exactly how their anticancer effect works.

[Speaker C]: Okay, you're listening to ask Europe, Dr. Kamie Di Garville, 91.1 FM. From now until the end of the show at 8 o', clock, you're invited to call in the questions related to cancer. The number is 707-923-3911.

[Speaker A]: And we're still in our little fundraising thing. Could you maybe put out a plea to your listeners? Because I know there's people who tune in from literally all over the world for this show. It's kind of a unique radio station that we have this platform for Dr. Pete here and for you guys. And it's pledge drive time.

[Speaker C]: Okay.

[Speaker B]: Yeah.

[Speaker C]: Well, for those people that are listening to the show, just want you to recognize that we still have a free speech radio program. I think that's the most important thing that people need to remember I've said this before, that free speech is very important. It's one of our main principal constitutional rights to hear both sides of the discussion. I think when things become one sided, that's when we become seriously in trouble. And so this radio station has many different people speaking on many different platforms. And what I really appreciate is that they give time for both sides. They give time to all sides. They're not exclusive. So as one of those few places, I think that is still left, they have a pretty balanced viewpoint from people from different camps. And so it's got to be something that you guys value here, especially people living, I think, up in the hills, etc. Some of these people, they listen to this show a lot. It's one of their main sources of information. They get news articles from around the world. It's not just local politics, but national and international. And so if you want to keep the radio station going, folks, I strongly encourage you to send money in and donations, however much you can afford. It does need to be funded. It does get some funding externally, but it definitely has a shortfall in its budget annually. But every year people donate and they step up to the plate. And thank goodness KMUD is still on the airwaves. I appreciate it very much to give us a platform here to give people alternatives. And for those people that are listening now, please, if you haven't already joined as a member, please consider calling in giving a donation, either a one time or a revolving donation. It all goes to help keep this local radio station going and out of the hands of sole proprietors with single genders. So please go ahead and make that call.

[Speaker A]: Yeah, I'm not even so sure that we're trying to have every side of every idea, you know, put out across the air. It's more that as a community, we have so many different community members who do have a little time on air that all together in the aggregate, we get an awful lot of opinions. And if you don't hear an opinion on here that you want to hear on here, then that's when you call in and thank Jobs Friday or some other show when it's appropriate and express your opinion. Or all sides now.

[Speaker C]: Okay? So once again, the number 707-923-3911. So, Dr. Pepys, just getting back to the herbal medicine perspective of improving the connective tissue and strengthening the connective tissue and the interstitium being a pathway, a highway that through which fluids move and can either be picked up in the lymphatic, if they are things like bacteria or yeast or fungal spores, et cetera, and trapped and dealt with and neutralized. The cancer is also able to use this same highway to be taken to distant sites. But there definitely is a rationale for improving the connective tissue itself, as cancer cells and cancers locally break down adjacent tissues and invade them in their quest for access to the vasculature or lymphatics. What do you think about agents that we're familiar with? Things like horsetail, a rich source of silica, or whether it's phytolacca and the main components of phytolacca that have this lymphatic immune stimulating activity? Do you think there's a value in what do you see as A value in improving and toning the tissues. I know you mentioned a lot about calcium and calcium obviously is part and parcel of improving the extracellular matrix and its homeostasis between being stored in its own and being available in the bloodstream is something you see people get plenty of calcium for.

[Speaker B]: And the role of calcium is very closely related to energy metabolism and inflammation. When you're deficient in energy, you activate many of the pro inflammatory peptides and small lipid molecules. In an ideal situation, that momentary increase of inflammation can reactivate design repair processes, especially for the connective tissue. But getting the energy and essential nutrients provided is going to have an anti inflammatory effect which allows the energy production to take effect and maintain structural integrity. And the effect of adequate calcium in your diet is to oppose the excitatory effects of too much phosphate in your diet. So the calcium is having an anti inflammatory pro energy restoration effect. And that has the effect of maintaining structural integrity of the interstitium, the whole structural framework, the whole hold cells together.

[Speaker A]: We've got a caller.

[Speaker D]: Not only anti cancer, but you're mentioning the benefits it has on maintaining healthy connective tissue as well.

[Speaker B]: Yeah, keeping inflammation down and energy up.

[Speaker C]: Okay, so Michael, did you say that there was another caller?

[Speaker A]: Yes, there is a caller.

[Speaker C]: Yeah, go ahead. Let's take this next caller. Caller, where are you from? What's your question?

[Speaker D]: Hi, I'm from Garberville and I had a low grade bladder cancer and it came back again and they just take it out. But I was wondering if you had any recommendations and I think I'll take my answer on the air.

[Speaker C]: Okay, doctor, pull low grade bladder cancer. What would you suggest as being good approaches about? Obviously everything that we had previously talked about, but go ahead and speak to that.

[Speaker B]: There have been several people developed effective treatments by infusing a mixture of nutrients, vitamin A related things, proteolytic enzymes and stabilizing anti inflammatory things such as I think lidocaine was one of them, into the bladder and then arranging the person's posture so that the mixture is in contact with the actual tumor itself. So you can get a very, very high concentration on the tumor. And several of those procedures have been very effective at removing persistent bladder tumors.

[Speaker D]: Okay, so let me just repeat that to make sure that we heard you correctly. So you said there's been research done to show that an infusion of proteolytic enzymes, vitamin A compounds and lidocaine. Lidocaine infused with the person laying down in such a way that the, you know, whether it was on the back of the bladder wall or the front of the bladder wall laying on their back or their front? Is that what you mean?

[Speaker B]: Yeah. I'm not sure if that was a complete list of the ingredients, but two or three groups were using very similar groups with a very high cure rate.

[Speaker A]: And what is infusion in this context.

[Speaker B]: For treating tumors on the wall of the bladder?

[Speaker A]: Are you putting that up through the urethra or are you drinking?

[Speaker C]: Oh, yeah.

[Speaker B]: Filling the bladder with a mixture, half filling it.

[Speaker D]: All right. And you also said anti inflammatory things, so maybe like aspirin, maybe. Would they have infused aspirin into the bladder?

[Speaker B]: I didn't hear that.

[Speaker C]: Would they have used something like aspirin as well as an anti inflammatory?

[Speaker B]: I always recommend aspirin for any cancer. It reduces inflammation, helps to restore the energy level, and has at least a dozen effects that help to control or eliminate cancer. Okay, good.

[Speaker C]: Okay. You're listening to ask your doctor. Kmudi Garbabool, 91.1 FM. From now until the close of the show at 8 o', clock, you're invited to call in the questions. The number is 707-923-3911. Dr. Raymond Pete with us in the studio.

[Speaker D]: And sorry, I just wanted to say I would like to put the warning out there that if people are choosing to use aspirin for treating their own cancers and they're doing a home treatment like that, you should really call us and we'll give you the instructions on how to take aspirin safely in conjunction with vitamin K2. It's very important if you're taking more than a baby aspirin a day that you take vitamin K2 to prevent blood bleeding.

[Speaker A]: And also you don't really have until 8 o'. Clock. You should call right away because we got to give them time to finish up. And if you do call in right away, you got to keep it brief.

[Speaker D]: No, what I mean, sorry. If anyone wants to use aspirin any more than a baby aspirin a day, then email us or call us at our number, which is Western Botanical Medicine, 707986 9506. And our email is either andrew or sarahesternbotanicalmedicine.com and Sarah is with an H S A R a h@westernbotanicalmedicine.com okay, so.

[Speaker C]: Dr. Pete, how about, I mean, again, aspirin, I think, just as we mentioned it, talking about the coagulopathy that happens with cancer and even if it's not stimulated by estrogen, which promotes blood Thickening and clotting and is pro cancer in its own right. The approach to treatment as anticoagulopathy treatment in terms of making the platelets less sticky, making blood flow more easily. Do you think this would be would have a good rational basis in science for using things like aspirin and garlic and things like ginkgo and other things that got traditional use for improving blood flow and preventing clotting?

[Speaker B]: The clotting system and the platelets are very central to the ability of of the metastatic cells to get across the blood vessel into the area it's going to colonize as metastatic cancer. And various things that decrease the stickiness and the tendency to coagulate of the platelets. Several of these substances have been studied and very strongly discourage metastatic spread and so increase the survival rate. Lidocaine, aspirin and progesterone are just three of the factors that have been over and over demonstrated to interfere with the metastatic stickiness and ability to travel in the cancer cells. It makes them stay home and not hurt anything.

[Speaker D]: Stay home cancer, stay home.

[Speaker C]: My next question, kind of anti angiogenic activity to manage cancer. A little bit like diabetes, because diabetes has been implicated in the breakdown of vascular walls.

[Speaker B]: There were studies in the 40s and 50s showing that the longer people left their cancer untreated, the longer they lived. And several studies have looked at the statistics on the population in general showing that the more you treat in some cancers, the survival rate stays the same no matter how much you do to the patient. But in some cases, the more you treat, the higher the death rate is. That was first seen distinctly in the case of prostate cancer in the early 90s. And by the end of the century, this had impressed enough prostate specialists that they came up with the idea of watchful waiting, figuring that if you don't use any of the harmful treatments such as high dose estrogen to treat prostate cancer and just watch what's happening, don't do multiple biopsies and so on. But the normal aging process happens faster than the development of a normal old man's prostate cancer. And that's a well established concept now that watchful waiting has actually improved the mortality rate from cancer failing to treat it.

[Speaker D]: Well, what's that statistic you quote, Dr. Peete? That 99% or 99.9% of people over the age of 50 have some form of abdominal cancer. 99.9% of people will not die of.

[Speaker B]: Cancer in an autopsy. You can find cancer essentially in 100% of the people over 50 if you look for it. It's part of a natural healing process and most people just coexist with many of these little cancers that aren't really hurting anything.

[Speaker C]: I think on a very quick side note, just for people's, for people to help people if they want to try this themselves, advocate self treatment generally. But on a very small side note, I had a keratosis, what I thought was a keratosis on the side of my nose. And I spoken to you about this, Dr. Pete, three or four years ago. I had it for two years. It obviously wasn't healthy cells, it was unhealthy cells.

[Speaker B]: In your latest photograph, your nose looks fine. No, no defect at all.

[Speaker C]: I just wanted to tell people that I had it. Fortunately or unfortunately, I did have a biopsy done and it identified it as basal cell carcinoma. And of course they wanted to do this and everything with it, which I refused. I went ahead and did what you suggested I do. I don't have it anymore. I mean, folks, it's possible.

[Speaker B]: Your nose looks very. Anyway, before we end, I want to mention a book that I think might be the most important book published in the last two or three years just came out. It's Robert Kennedy Jr. S the Real Anthony Fauci. Give us a background for the not only the COVID 19 process, but the background going back decades.

[Speaker C]: Yeah, well, he's been there, isn't he, for 40 years or something. He's pretty entrenched. Dr. Fauci is pretty entrenched.

[Speaker B]: Yeah. But this book I think is going to change that.

[Speaker C]: Yeah, they said that possibly he's perjured himself. But anyway, thanks so much for your time. Dr. P is five to the hour and I know the engineer wants to wrap it up for 8 o' clock and we need to give people your information. So thanks so much for joining us.

[Speaker B]: Okay, thank you.

[Speaker D]: Thank you, Dr. Pete. Good night.

[Speaker C]: For those people who've listened to the show before or who just tuned in, Dr. Raymond Peet's got a wealth of experience. He's been doing this over 40 years. He's written several books. He's published hundreds, hundreds of articles. He's a very altruistic character, as most people who know him can attest. His website is raypeept.com r a y pet.com and so his journal articles there are well referenced. He's a very scientific person. He doesn't, he doesn't believe in hocus pocus and crystal dangling and whatever else. I'm sorry to offend some people who maybe use crystals. I'm not saying they don't work or do anything, but it's generally a do less than do something proactive situation. So we can be contacted Monday through Friday, Wilton botanicalmedicine.com the 707-986-9506 and so until the December version, we will look forward to seeing you, hearing from you, answering questions, give us feedback, and thanks so much for your time.

[Speaker D]: Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving and thanks for tuning in. My name is Sarah Murray.

[Speaker B]: My name is Andrew Murray.

[Speaker D]: Good night.

[Speaker B]: Sam SA Sam.
