## Transcript

[Speaker 0]: Okay.

[Speaker 0]: It's just like that. It's 07:00.

[Speaker 0]: You are listening to Redwood Community Radio, KMUD

[Speaker 0]: Garberville,

[Speaker 0]: 91.1

[Speaker 0]: FM in HD 1. KMUE Eureka, 88.1 FM in HD 1. KLAI, Laytonville, 90.3 FM. On the web, kmud.org,

[Speaker 0]: and in Shelter Cove at 99.5

[Speaker 0]: on FM translator K258BQ.

[Speaker 1]: Well,

[Speaker 1]: good evening and welcome to Ask Your Herb Doctor. This

[Speaker 1]: is 06/17/2022.

[Speaker 1]: My name is Andrew Murray.

[Speaker 2]: My name is Sarah Johannessen Murray.

[Speaker 1]: So once again, welcome to the show, which runs from seven till 08:00. And at 07:30, we open the lines up to invite callers in with questions

[Speaker 1]: related to this month's topic, which is going to be around food and the corporation's control of food and

[Speaker 1]: some ongoing

[Speaker 1]: numbers and statistics

[Speaker 1]: from the COVID outfall.

[Speaker 1]: And then we're going to get into

[Speaker 1]: some parts of the political

[Speaker 1]: discourse and involvement in big companies in The Ukraine and fertilizer production.

[Speaker 1]: And then hopefully, we're going to get to the topic of the baby milk shortage,

[Speaker 1]: followed up with some artificial meat topics. And

[Speaker 1]: as always, I have the great pleasure of having Doctor. Pete's

[Speaker 1]: superb

[Speaker 1]: overview of a lot of things. And I guess it's part of his age

[Speaker 1]: that enables him to

[Speaker 1]: encompass

[Speaker 1]: 70

[Speaker 1]: well, he's certainly older than that,

[Speaker 1]: but he encompasses at least forty, fifty years of time spent studying the subjects and another three decades on top of that of living

[Speaker 1]: for this amount of time to see

[Speaker 1]: the events unfolding

[Speaker 1]: that have done.

[Speaker 1]: So, he's got a pretty good rounded

[Speaker 1]: view of many different subjects and obviously, alternative medicine is one of them. And he's been,

[Speaker 1]: obviously spending a large part of his life and his career,

[Speaker 1]: looking at the research, which is always the most interesting part of any of this factual

[Speaker 1]: information. It's not just opinion.

[Speaker 1]: So once again, very pleased to have Doctor. Raymond Piet Joy as join us on the show. Doctor. Piet, are you there? Yes. Okay. Well,

[Speaker 1]: if you don't mind me just for the next five minutes or so, I just wanted to run

[Speaker 1]: an introduction to

[Speaker 1]: some of the questions that I'll be asking you and getting your opinion on.

[Speaker 1]: But just wanted to wrap up last month's

[Speaker 1]: discourse. We talked about

[Speaker 1]: generic modification and corporations with patent rights on

[Speaker 1]: intellectual property that they are saying, especially Monsanto

[Speaker 1]: with their genetically engineered seeds

[Speaker 1]: and the quote unquote moratorium

[Speaker 1]: that was on natural products certainly seems to have been put to one side now where naturally occurring products like corn,

[Speaker 1]: wheat and potatoes etcetera,

[Speaker 1]: although they're natural, they have now been granted patent rights on their genetically modified

[Speaker 1]: versions of them.

[Speaker 1]: And I think this also runs into

[Speaker 1]: technology and obviously the emerging

[Speaker 1]: infections that we've gone through since the late or mid-1990s

[Speaker 1]: up until now with COVID obviously being the major part of our prior two year discourse on the events of COVID.

[Speaker 1]: I also wanted to remind people that the

[Speaker 1]: lawyer, Rainer Formic, is, well, I think he's still presenting it but has a huge amount of data on the website

[Speaker 1]: which I would encourage everyone to look at as a

[Speaker 1]: superb chronologically

[Speaker 1]: documented series of allegations, which essentially is,

[Speaker 1]: charging crimes against humanity,

[Speaker 1]: for many

[Speaker 1]: organizations,

[Speaker 1]: institutions,

[Speaker 1]: and governments.

[Speaker 1]: And that website is as a secure website, httpscolon//radical,ratical,.org,

[Speaker 1]: /pandemic

[Speaker 1]: parallax view.

[Speaker 1]: That should get you there. There's a bit more in the URL, but essentially,

[Speaker 1]: radical.org

[Speaker 1]: and then pandemic parallax view.

[Speaker 1]: So lists every detail about the beginning from the Wuhan lab, Fauci, the funding of it all up until the present point, and why people have been so hoodwinked over what's happened.

[Speaker 1]: Also mentioned last month that the United Nations

[Speaker 1]: has changed the terminology from technocracy to green economy and sustainable development and how that

[Speaker 1]: impacts us all very negatively because it sounds so innocuous and harmless

[Speaker 1]: sustainable development. Who doesn't want sustainability? We all do. I do. I want local

[Speaker 1]: markets. I want people growing food locally. I don't want huge

[Speaker 1]: corporations shipping food from one side of the world to the other and displacing rural farmers, you know. So we want sustainable development, but the words sustainable development have been couched in such a way as to embrace this technocracy, which we

[Speaker 1]: exposed last month as really beginning from about the 1920s. And Doctor. Pete certainly weighed in on what he understands of technocracy having lived through it. And then obviously, the Rockefeller Foundation and

[Speaker 1]: all the other power players that are forming the heads of government institutions and global organizations,

[Speaker 1]: from

[Speaker 1]: the Codex Alimentarius

[Speaker 1]: series of programs that we did a long time ago.

[Speaker 1]: Rheem Olaybo has exposed that as being part of a world government order to get us all to this point that we've heard recently about the Great Reset.

[Speaker 1]: So anyway, that was just an overview of last month. So I wanted just to open up this month and I hadn't mentioned this earlier, Doctor. Pete, but it's something that caught my eye was that while I was looking at the information for this month's show,

[Speaker 1]: that the fifth largest life insurance company in The U. S.

[Speaker 1]: Has just paid out 163%

[Speaker 1]: more for deaths of working people, folks. Not old old people just ready to die,

[Speaker 1]: but working

[Speaker 1]: people from 18 to 64.

[Speaker 1]: So that group,

[Speaker 1]: they paid out 163%

[Speaker 1]: more for deaths for that age group.

[Speaker 1]: So company the company cites a non pandemic related morbidity and unusual claims adjustments

[Speaker 1]: is the explanation of losses from Group Life Insurance businesses. And the stock is falling and the CEO has been replaced, etcetera, and they're trying to prop this up. So the head of an Indianapolis based insurance company, One America, said the death rate is up a stunning forty percent

[Speaker 1]: from pre pandemic levels among working age people. Now, five months after breaking this story

[Speaker 1]: of the CEO of One America insurance company saying deaths among working people ages 18 to

[Speaker 1]: 64 were up forty percent in the 2021.

[Speaker 1]: A new report

[Speaker 1]: is out

[Speaker 1]: that a much larger life insurance company namely Lincoln National

[Speaker 1]: reported 163%

[Speaker 1]: increase in death benefits paid out under its group life insurance policies in 2021.

[Speaker 1]: To quote One America, the company CEO, Scott Davidson,

[Speaker 1]: stated that we are seeing right now the highest death rates we've seen in the history of this business, not just at One America.

[Speaker 1]: The data is consistent across every player in the business.

[Speaker 1]: Now One America is a $100,000,000,000

[Speaker 1]: insurance company that

[Speaker 1]: has had its headquarters in Indianapolis since 1877.

[Speaker 1]: The company has approximately 2,400

[Speaker 1]: employees and sells life insurance, including group life insurance to employees

[Speaker 1]: and employers

[Speaker 1]: in the state.

[Speaker 1]: And Davidson said the increase in death represents huge, huge numbers and that it's not elderly people who are dying, but primarily working age people, 18 through 64,

[Speaker 1]: who are the employees of companies that have group life insurance play plans through One America.

[Speaker 1]: And what we saw just in third quarter, we're seeing it continue into fourth quarter, and that is

[Speaker 1]: that death rates are up forty percent over what they were pre pandemic.

[Speaker 1]: Just to give you an idea of how bad that is, a three sigma or a one in two hundred year catastrophe would be ten percent increase over pre pandemic.

[Speaker 1]: So forty percent is just unheard of. Now,

[Speaker 1]: what is driving this unprecedented surge in,

[Speaker 1]: quotes, all cause mortality?

[Speaker 1]: It was not only deaths of working age people that shot up to unheard of levels in 2021, but also short and long term disability claims.

[Speaker 1]: Now if this holds true, then the genetic vaccine so aggressively promoted have failed. And the clear federal campaign to prevent early treatment with life saving drugs has contributed to a massive avoidable loss of life.

[Speaker 1]: At worst,

[Speaker 1]: this report implies that the federal workplace vaccine mandates have driven what appeared to be a true crime against humanity.

[Speaker 1]: Massive loss of life in, presumably, workers that have been forced to accept a toxic vaccine at higher frequency relative to the general population of Indiana.

[Speaker 1]: And furthermore, we've also been living through the most massive globally coordinated propaganda

[Speaker 1]: and censorship campaign in the history of the human race.

[Speaker 1]: All major mass media and the social media technology companies have coordinated to stifle and suppress any discussion of the risks of the genetic vaccines and or alternative early treatments.

[Speaker 1]: Between artificial intelligence powered algorithms

[Speaker 1]: and social media tech giants complicit in their communist style suppression of information,

[Speaker 1]: we've witnessed an avoidable mass casualty event,

[Speaker 1]: needlessly caused by a mandated

[Speaker 1]: experimental medical procedure which obliterated and eviscerated the first amendment of the constitution of The United States in the process.

[Speaker 1]: How you may well ask yourself, did this happen?

[Speaker 1]: By deceit, collusion, and corruption,

[Speaker 1]: all tools used by evil people with wicked intent against their brothers and sisters, an international corrupt cabal,

[Speaker 1]: as well as by our very own complacency and failure to speak out en masse.

[Speaker 1]: So, doctor Pete, with that introduction, I'm sure it's not news to you. I know you've been, pretty tirelessly talking about this since the very beginning of 2020.

[Speaker 1]: What what are your interpretations

[Speaker 1]: of this insurance company's disclosure of these facts revealed by public records request? It wasn't freely sent out, but

[Speaker 1]: a company requested this.

[Speaker 3]: Several

[Speaker 3]: other companies

[Speaker 3]: since then have

[Speaker 3]: reported very similar

[Speaker 3]: increased mortality,

[Speaker 3]: around forty percent in the

[Speaker 3]: working age group.

[Speaker 3]: And

[Speaker 3]: so

[Speaker 3]: it's insurance companies

[Speaker 3]: generally have extremely

[Speaker 3]: accurate statistics,

[Speaker 3]: better than governments

[Speaker 3]: as a rule

[Speaker 3]: because

[Speaker 3]: their income depends on

[Speaker 3]: exactness.

[Speaker 3]: And so

[Speaker 3]: it's really

[Speaker 3]: the scientific basis for

[Speaker 3]: saying that,

[Speaker 3]: it wasn't the

[Speaker 3]: virus that's responsible but the

[Speaker 3]: vaccination.

[Speaker 3]: That's that's when the forty percent rise

[Speaker 3]: began.

[Speaker 3]: And

[Speaker 3]: it fits the

[Speaker 3]: virologists,

[Speaker 3]: the the skeptical virologists

[Speaker 3]: have been claiming that,

[Speaker 3]: that the

[Speaker 3]: mortality is

[Speaker 3]: going to be far, far worse

[Speaker 3]: from the vaccine than from whatever

[Speaker 3]: occurred from the

[Speaker 3]: virus.

[Speaker 1]: Bruce, I think that was the, the point that was made mentioned that it was all cause now all cause mortality in young people

[Speaker 1]: and it was a lot of it was to do with damage and disability.

[Speaker 1]: So whether the death may have been,

[Speaker 1]: you know, caused by the vaccine or not, the amount of money paid out due to the disabilities that were,

[Speaker 1]: claimed. I think this is this is a pretty, a pretty stunning part of the,

[Speaker 1]: the numbers that we use to cite them, the the payments.

[Speaker 1]: And, I think we've mentioned in the past that the,

[Speaker 1]: when we're describing things like mortality and altitude,

[Speaker 1]: it was the very insurance companies that actually let that information out, which supported that claim that,

[Speaker 1]: that lower premiums were basically imposed on people at higher altitude because they really were not

[Speaker 1]: as likely as people at sea level to die.

[Speaker 1]: Yeah.

[Speaker 1]: Okay. So that's the first thing. Just seeing some kind of glaring headlines about

[Speaker 1]: deaths and insurance companies making payouts and

[Speaker 1]: how this is now just part of the fallout

[Speaker 1]: of COVID and everything that happened to

[Speaker 1]: try to mitigate

[Speaker 1]: this virus.

[Speaker 1]: Anyway, so that's been fairly, fairly long,

[Speaker 1]: a fairly long process here for the last two years now. And supposedly now what we're seeing, not supposedly, but I think it's the actuality of it all,

[Speaker 1]: with Omicron, whether or not Omicron,

[Speaker 1]: I don't know. If you if you feel that

[Speaker 1]: whether or not your opinion is that Omicron is a naturally

[Speaker 1]: produced variant,

[Speaker 1]: or indeed

[Speaker 1]: any other type of,

[Speaker 3]: it it has

[Speaker 3]: the most bizarre

[Speaker 3]: gene sequences

[Speaker 3]: of

[Speaker 3]: all of the other variants because

[Speaker 3]: starting with the Wuhan,

[Speaker 3]: the other variants

[Speaker 3]: show

[Speaker 3]: a series

[Speaker 3]: of mutations

[Speaker 3]: building

[Speaker 3]: on each other.

[Speaker 3]: So the most recent

[Speaker 3]: until Omicron

[Speaker 3]: showed exactly the same series

[Speaker 3]: of mutations incorporated,

[Speaker 3]: so it was

[Speaker 3]: definitely

[Speaker 3]: that virus

[Speaker 3]: improving its survivability

[Speaker 3]: by mutating.

[Speaker 3]: But

[Speaker 3]: the Omicron

[Speaker 3]: is unique.

[Speaker 3]: It didn't show any

[Speaker 3]: mutations

[Speaker 3]: after Wuhan.

[Speaker 3]: For the

[Speaker 3]: Wuhan virus was going through

[Speaker 3]: all of these changes,

[Speaker 3]: nothing was happening at all to to the

[Speaker 3]: omicron.

[Speaker 3]: Suddenly, when it pops up,

[Speaker 3]: it is essentially

[Speaker 3]: the pristine

[Speaker 3]: Wuhan virus,

[Speaker 3]: with

[Speaker 3]: a new series

[Speaker 3]: built

[Speaker 3]: right on

[Speaker 3]: the original

[Speaker 3]: virus.

[Speaker 3]: None of the history

[Speaker 3]: of of natural mutation

[Speaker 3]: as it was being held held aside

[Speaker 3]: and going through

[Speaker 3]: different series

[Speaker 3]: of mutations

[Speaker 3]: as if it wasn't in the world at all for these

[Speaker 3]: intervening years.

[Speaker 2]: So are you

[Speaker 2]: so are you saying that basically

[Speaker 2]: the original COVID

[Speaker 2]: went through mutations and you can track that, and then all of a sudden, Omicron

[Speaker 2]: was like the original

[Speaker 2]: with just some alterations to it. So it looked like it had been lab produced or produced in a lab?

[Speaker 3]: Yeah.

[Speaker 3]: And those

[Speaker 3]: mutations

[Speaker 3]: made it

[Speaker 3]: much less harmful.

[Speaker 3]: So it was

[Speaker 3]: if someone was praying preparing a

[Speaker 3]: a product to

[Speaker 3]: end the

[Speaker 3]: pandemic by

[Speaker 3]: turning them off with a fairly

[Speaker 3]: harmless

[Speaker 3]: virus.

[Speaker 2]: So do you think that when if people have Omicron and they've developed antibodies to that and caught that naturally, even though it's not a naturally

[Speaker 2]: mutated virus,

[Speaker 2]: then will they be

[Speaker 2]: better able to fight the original

[Speaker 2]: Delta or those other variants?

[Speaker 3]: No. It won't especially

[Speaker 3]: affect them.

[Speaker 3]: It'll just

[Speaker 3]: if it's

[Speaker 3]: the dominant virus

[Speaker 3]: and it's very harmless,

[Speaker 3]: then

[Speaker 3]: the other one just isn't going to be around

[Speaker 3]: to cause trouble.

[Speaker 1]: Okay. You're listening to Ask Your Reb Doctor. K. Moody Gamaboo91.1

[Speaker 1]: FM.

[Speaker 1]: From 07:30 till the end of the show, callers are invited to call in with any questions either related to this month's discussion

[Speaker 1]: or indeed any other questions they'd like to pose to doctor Pete, about health related or quote unquote alternative medicine.

[Speaker 1]: The number's (707) 923-3911.

[Speaker 1]: So from 07:30 till the end of the show, 08:00,

[Speaker 1]: callers call in to (707)

[Speaker 1]: 923-3911.

[Speaker 1]: Okay. So moving on to, the kind of major content of

[Speaker 1]: this next forty minutes, forty five minutes,

[Speaker 1]: I read an article about the Oakland Institute and this was a 2014

[Speaker 1]: article. And the

[Speaker 1]: article

[Speaker 1]: is certainly,

[Speaker 1]: yeah,

[Speaker 1]: nearly

[Speaker 1]: eight years later,

[Speaker 1]: what we're seeing now in Ukraine

[Speaker 1]: and Russia,

[Speaker 1]: it's kind of not really a political

[Speaker 1]: question but, you know, it

[Speaker 1]: is really

[Speaker 1]: a question that's embroiled in

[Speaker 1]: health and

[Speaker 1]: government control and takeovers

[Speaker 1]: and, you know, aggressive

[Speaker 1]: campaigning

[Speaker 1]: of which,

[Speaker 1]: you know, people have

[Speaker 1]: certainly heard a lot about Roundup and Monsanto.

[Speaker 1]: And we've all heard about GMO and Monsanto

[Speaker 1]: and it's a huge corporation.

[Speaker 1]: So

[Speaker 1]: the Oakland Institute,

[Speaker 1]: like I said, published a 2014

[Speaker 1]: paper outlining

[Speaker 1]: what was being described then as a global

[Speaker 1]: corporate takeover of agricultural land in The Ukraine.

[Speaker 1]: And

[Speaker 1]: when you look at Ukraine, it's been hailed

[Speaker 1]: as the breadbasket of Europe,

[Speaker 1]: with a staggering 32,000,000

[Speaker 1]: plus hectares of incredibly fertile, black,

[Speaker 1]: arable soil.

[Speaker 1]: Now, for those of you who are gardeners, or horticulturalists,

[Speaker 1]: or farmers, you're well aware of what this means to crops planted. In short, lush, rich, fertile growth with excellent crop yields and quality harvests.

[Speaker 1]: If you too are Monsanto,

[Speaker 1]: one of the biggest agribusinesses on the planet, or one of a handful of other players buying into this hugely profitable location,

[Speaker 1]: rights to ownership and to play this game is extremely lucrative, and corruption, as always, exists at the highest level for the highest returns,

[Speaker 1]: naturally.

[Speaker 1]: Ukraine's agricultural land was under a moratorium that banned its sale,

[Speaker 1]: through 01/01/2016.

[Speaker 1]: And when Ukraine separated from the Soviet Union in 1990,

[Speaker 1]: collectivized

[Speaker 1]: communal farms were disbanded,

[Speaker 1]: and land was distributed in parcels approximately four hectares

[Speaker 1]: each to people living on the collectivized

[Speaker 1]: farms.

[Speaker 1]: In 02/2001, Ukraine passed its land code

[Speaker 1]: legislation that gave people functional titles to land. And since then, there's been a moratorium on the sale of land, which, as noted, was extended through 01/01/2016.

[Speaker 1]: The moratorium on land sales applies only to agricultural land, making it both legal and affordable for investors to build and operate a 100%

[Speaker 1]: foreign owned processing facility on its own industrial land while leasing fields from agricultural landowners

[Speaker 1]: until the moratorium on the sale of agricultural land was lifted.

[Speaker 1]: A second way that investors could circumvent the land moratorium

[Speaker 1]: was by buying shares of large existing Ukrainian agribusinesses.

[Speaker 1]: The system of land distribution in the 1990s

[Speaker 1]: often led to the concentration of land in the hand of a few elites.

[Speaker 1]: Alongside land, opportunities in Ukraine for the development, production and the use of agricultural inputs like seeds,

[Speaker 1]: agrochemicals

[Speaker 1]: and fertilizers

[Speaker 1]: have attracted investment by agribusiness giants Monsanto,

[Speaker 1]: Cargill,

[Speaker 1]: DuPont and others.

[Speaker 1]: So I was going to ask you, Doctor. Pete,

[Speaker 1]: you had lots of other information

[Speaker 1]: to tie this.

[Speaker 3]: Everyone has heard about the International

[Speaker 3]: Monetary Fund

[Speaker 3]: Yeah. Offering

[Speaker 3]: Ukraine

[Speaker 3]: a $40,000,000,000

[Speaker 3]: loan

[Speaker 3]: if they would

[Speaker 3]: stop the moratorium

[Speaker 3]: specifically

[Speaker 3]: so Monsanto

[Speaker 3]: and

[Speaker 3]: the other giant corporations

[Speaker 3]: could

[Speaker 3]: concentrate

[Speaker 3]: ownership

[Speaker 3]: on a big corporate scale.

[Speaker 3]: And that

[Speaker 3]: that there was a coup

[Speaker 3]: to

[Speaker 3]: make make that happen

[Speaker 3]: because the elected president

[Speaker 3]: had

[Speaker 3]: rejected

[Speaker 3]: the IMF fund.

[Speaker 3]: And the IMF,

[Speaker 3]: working with

[Speaker 3]: World Bank and

[Speaker 3]: all of the other

[Speaker 3]: so called Western authorities

[Speaker 3]: wanted

[Speaker 3]: to reverse

[Speaker 3]: that, stop the moratorium,

[Speaker 3]: and so they supported the coup.

[Speaker 3]: And the coup was very clear that they were going to

[Speaker 3]: adapt laws that would

[Speaker 3]: let Monsanto take over.

[Speaker 3]: And

[Speaker 3]: when the coup happened, in fact,

[Speaker 3]: that that did take place, and

[Speaker 3]: so they

[Speaker 3]: had to

[Speaker 3]: get get rid of the

[Speaker 3]: legally elected president

[Speaker 3]: and

[Speaker 3]: establish

[Speaker 3]: the the

[Speaker 3]: Zelensky

[Speaker 3]: Mhmm. Government supporting

[Speaker 3]: the the Monsanto privatization

[Speaker 3]: system.

[Speaker 1]: So how do you see Russia's involvement? I mean, because it seems to be a two sided story. Some people

[Speaker 1]: say that, you know, the Ukraine from a political and or ownership

[Speaker 1]: geographical perspective.

[Speaker 3]: Well, part of the Monsanto thing

[Speaker 3]: is that,

[Speaker 3]: that they want to use

[Speaker 3]: chemicals round up Right.

[Speaker 3]: To to make

[Speaker 3]: the profitability

[Speaker 3]: of certain giant

[Speaker 3]: land

[Speaker 3]: corporations

[Speaker 3]: favorable to them.

[Speaker 3]: And the

[Speaker 3]: European

[Speaker 3]: Union had opposed

[Speaker 3]: The

[Speaker 3]: United States policy

[Speaker 3]: of

[Speaker 3]: supporting Monsanto

[Speaker 3]: and genetic modification.

[Speaker 3]: And so the

[Speaker 3]: there was a conflict between Western Europe,

[Speaker 3]: who had quite a lot of resistance.

[Speaker 3]: Several European

[Speaker 3]: Western European countries

[Speaker 3]: went along with

[Speaker 3]: wanting to outlaw

[Speaker 3]: GMOs.

[Speaker 3]: Mhmm.

[Speaker 3]: And

[Speaker 3]: that

[Speaker 3]: was

[Speaker 3]: creating

[Speaker 3]: stresses between

[Speaker 3]: Western Europe

[Speaker 3]: and

[Speaker 3]: the

[Speaker 3]: anti GMO people. And

[Speaker 3]: it turned out that

[Speaker 3]: historically,

[Speaker 3]: Russia

[Speaker 3]: had been

[Speaker 3]: passing laws

[Speaker 3]: to promote

[Speaker 3]: organic farming Right.

[Speaker 3]: And to outlaw GMOs. And so

[Speaker 3]: they were aiming for a 100%

[Speaker 3]: freedom

[Speaker 3]: from GMOs and naturally

[Speaker 3]: from Monsanto.

[Speaker 3]: And the the

[Speaker 3]: that that really

[Speaker 3]: was the polarization

[Speaker 3]: for for the coup,

[Speaker 3]: for the International Monetary Fund

[Speaker 3]: loan.

[Speaker 3]: When

[Speaker 3]: the elected president

[Speaker 3]: made a deal with Russia

[Speaker 3]: for

[Speaker 3]: a loan that would

[Speaker 3]: bypass the

[Speaker 3]: International

[Speaker 3]: Monetary Fund.

[Speaker 3]: That was

[Speaker 3]: the the actual moment when when the coup

[Speaker 3]: took place and they

[Speaker 3]: cut him out of out of Ukraine.

[Speaker 1]: I'd, I read well, I think it was a couple of years ago and so you can back me up on this that,

[Speaker 1]: Vladimir Putin was boasting,

[Speaker 1]: that he was gonna make Russia

[Speaker 1]: one of the, if not the biggest,

[Speaker 1]: organic food producer in the world. Yeah, that's what

[Speaker 2]: one of his goals was. But I mean, I thought GMOs are still banned in Europe. Well, I think they are in England. I'm pretty sure England have banned GMOs in No. I thought in England, they're not banned but because they're not part of the EU. So the EU is banned GMOs. Is that what you're understanding, doctor Pete?

[Speaker 3]: They are

[Speaker 3]: wobbling

[Speaker 3]: on the issue. There is still

[Speaker 3]: opposition to it, but the

[Speaker 3]: now the war for

[Speaker 3]: Monsanto

[Speaker 3]: has affected the West,

[Speaker 3]: and

[Speaker 3]: they

[Speaker 3]: aren't pushing so hard to to oppose the GMOs.

[Speaker 1]: I wonder how the, the whole fertilizer shortage again, as I said, apparently Ukraine is a big exporter or manufacturer of fertilizer.

[Speaker 1]: I wonder how that plays into it along with the,

[Speaker 1]: the agricultural,

[Speaker 1]: like, rich diversity that there is possible there in Ukraine and how this quote unquote food shortages now, they're talking about. Before we get into the subject of baby milk,

[Speaker 1]: the food shortage issue,

[Speaker 1]: I wonder how

[Speaker 1]: I wonder how politically motivated this is in terms of, polling? Oh, you can

[Speaker 3]: see many specific things in which it's

[Speaker 3]: been

[Speaker 3]: just openly

[Speaker 3]: promoted. For example,

[Speaker 3]: Union Pacific

[Speaker 3]: Railroad

[Speaker 3]: announced that

[Speaker 3]: they just weren't going to ship

[Speaker 3]: all of

[Speaker 3]: the fertilizer

[Speaker 3]: that the farmers needed.

[Speaker 3]: And

[Speaker 3]: that preceded by several weeks

[Speaker 3]: the announcement that they were

[Speaker 3]: not going to

[Speaker 3]: allow the shipment

[Speaker 3]: and sale

[Speaker 3]: of urea,

[Speaker 3]: which is used

[Speaker 3]: in the diesel

[Speaker 3]: motors of trucks

[Speaker 3]: and

[Speaker 3]: by

[Speaker 3]: restricting

[Speaker 3]: the

[Speaker 3]: availability

[Speaker 3]: of this urea

[Speaker 3]: fuel

[Speaker 3]: modifier

[Speaker 3]: that

[Speaker 3]: they can turn off

[Speaker 3]: truck delivery too.

[Speaker 3]: But

[Speaker 3]: as a railroad, they

[Speaker 3]: since they said they're not gonna ship

[Speaker 3]: all of the fertilizer that's ordered.

[Speaker 2]: And why did they say that?

[Speaker 3]: No one knows, but

[Speaker 3]: it seems seems to be that

[Speaker 3]: they are controlled by

[Speaker 3]: Black Rock,

[Speaker 3]: the giant funds.

[Speaker 2]: Black Rock.

[Speaker 3]: And that

[Speaker 3]: that

[Speaker 3]: is

[Speaker 3]: also just openly

[Speaker 3]: intending to turn off the the food economy.

[Speaker 2]: I mean, really, it's So they're they want to create a shortage

[Speaker 2]: for some

[Speaker 2]: monetary gain?

[Speaker 3]: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

[Speaker 3]: If you look at the pattern over the last several years when

[Speaker 3]: the at the very

[Speaker 3]: just weeks before the

[Speaker 3]: pandemic,

[Speaker 3]: cloud swab

[Speaker 3]: was saying,

[Speaker 3]: well, we've

[Speaker 3]: done our best to use

[Speaker 3]: the carbon dioxide

[Speaker 3]: climate change,

[Speaker 3]: mistaken science

[Speaker 3]: to fulfill our purpose

[Speaker 3]: of controlling

[Speaker 3]: the

[Speaker 3]: overall production. But

[Speaker 3]: now luckily,

[Speaker 3]: we've got something

[Speaker 3]: much, much better that

[Speaker 3]: in just

[Speaker 3]: a period of two or three years,

[Speaker 3]: we'll be able to turn off

[Speaker 3]: the

[Speaker 3]: national

[Speaker 3]: and world production of

[Speaker 3]: of of everything.

[Speaker 3]: The ordinary daily

[Speaker 3]: economy, including food

[Speaker 3]: and all

[Speaker 3]: of the necessary supply.

[Speaker 1]: I mean, you can't you can't make this stuff up. And I

[Speaker 1]: I this reminds me of that the whole

[Speaker 1]: discourse that I first heard with Rima Labo

[Speaker 1]: back in 02/2006,

[Speaker 1]: I think it was, Codex Alimentarius

[Speaker 1]: and how

[Speaker 1]: the entire thing is essentially a playbook,

[Speaker 1]: from

[Speaker 1]: from the end of the war or just before that, really, with the emergence

[Speaker 1]: of technocracy through

[Speaker 1]: to global governments and one world currency. It's all

[Speaker 1]: been documented and she the way she was talking

[Speaker 1]: back in 02/2006,

[Speaker 1]: I I obviously, it blew me away. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I just say, is this totally fantastic fantasy or is this, you know, aside looking into it. And the more you look at it, the more connections you see. And so when we get things like the war in Ukraine and we hear, well, actually, maybe, you know, Russia deciding on the side of

[Speaker 1]: organic production and, you know, yeah, it was part of former Russia. And so what really is the problem?

[Speaker 1]: I mean, obviously, there's problem with people dying. Don't get me wrong. I don't not condone any war. But the reasons by which this happened

[Speaker 1]: are serious government evil,

[Speaker 1]: prospects and control

[Speaker 1]: and manipulation

[Speaker 1]: of the populations of various countries to produce the narrative they want. And that's exactly what social media

[Speaker 1]: has seek has sought to bring about, since

[Speaker 1]: it all came out for Facebook and YouTube and all of the glorious technology of social media,

[Speaker 1]: you know, the advent of it. You know, back in 2009

[Speaker 1]: or so, we have when the iPhones were becoming really popular and the software to do this was connecting all these people like never before.

[Speaker 1]: So

[Speaker 1]: I kind of, you know, it might sound a little scary to people that are just listening to it, but there's a lot more in it. And unfortunately,

[Speaker 1]: I don't think there's a huge amount we can do about it except peacefully protest. And I think that's the saddest part of what I've witnessed going through these last two years is that there's such a polarization, there's such a control of information on the one hand that people are not getting the full information. I just heard today that Simone Gold,

[Speaker 1]: one of the doctors in LA of the American frontline doctors,

[Speaker 1]: who were organizing,

[Speaker 1]: you know, patient consultations

[Speaker 1]: and alternatives to COVID treatments that were, you know, the experimental drugs. She's just been in prison for two months.

[Speaker 1]: And this was all part and parcel of her,

[Speaker 1]: 2020

[Speaker 1]: appearance at the State Capitol and

[Speaker 1]: her peaceful protest. Yeah, peaceful protest basically saying that she objected to what was going on. And that the whole thing about free speech is like, if we're not careful folks, it's gone.

[Speaker 1]: You know, and getting ratted out by your neighbor is in and

[Speaker 1]: the Soviet style

[Speaker 1]: era of

[Speaker 1]: people watching people and people policing each each other,

[Speaker 1]: it's kind of a scary reality which I think has crept in so perva you know, pervasively with this COVID,

[Speaker 1]: quote unquote pandemic that most people are looking

[Speaker 1]: I don't know I'm quite not quite sure where,

[Speaker 1]: they're getting their information from that is countering this narrative that we hear about because it's

[Speaker 1]: it's everywhere you look. I mean to find an alternative view on the COVID,

[Speaker 1]: scenario is the kind of exception. Anyway, you're listening to Ask Your Own Doctor on Gab KME Decaiveau ninety one point one FM.

[Speaker 1]: From now until 08:00, the lines are open. Number (707)

[Speaker 1]: 923-3911.

[Speaker 1]: Once again, (707)

[Speaker 1]: 923-3911.

[Speaker 1]: Okay. So getting to

[Speaker 1]: the milk crisis, the baby milk crisis.

[Speaker 1]: I wonder what your opinion of this is because I know you've definitely got lots to say about

[Speaker 1]: soy and

[Speaker 1]: PUFA

[Speaker 1]: and

[Speaker 1]: all of these things. I mean, from a perspective of making money from a corporate perspective of,

[Speaker 1]: you know, mothers in Africa.

[Speaker 1]: And I'm not saying that

[Speaker 1]: women that have children that don't produce enough milk shouldn't be helped, of course not. But there are other alternatives to formula. So what do you think about this baby formula crisis? It may be not a bad thing.

[Speaker 3]: The soy formula

[Speaker 3]: had its own terrible

[Speaker 3]: side effects

[Speaker 3]: in immature animals.

[Speaker 3]: The estrogenic

[Speaker 3]: factors

[Speaker 3]: associated

[Speaker 3]: with the

[Speaker 3]: proteins

[Speaker 3]: used in making the male substitute

[Speaker 3]: are

[Speaker 3]: cause

[Speaker 3]: deformed genitals

[Speaker 3]: in the developing

[Speaker 3]: young

[Speaker 3]: and later later promote

[Speaker 3]: tumors of various sorts.

[Speaker 3]: So the

[Speaker 3]: the plant based milk formulas

[Speaker 3]: were

[Speaker 3]: a terrible problem

[Speaker 3]: in themselves.

[Speaker 3]: And Benzene,

[Speaker 3]: Nestle

[Speaker 3]: Innovations,

[Speaker 3]: basically

[Speaker 3]: selling dehydrated

[Speaker 3]: cow

[Speaker 3]: milk as a basis for

[Speaker 3]: people around the world

[Speaker 3]: to mix up

[Speaker 3]: at home,

[Speaker 3]: to produce a liquid

[Speaker 3]: milk substitute,

[Speaker 3]: despite the fact

[Speaker 3]: that clean clean water to mix it with

[Speaker 3]: is

[Speaker 3]: absent in so many

[Speaker 3]: of the poor countries.

[Speaker 3]: So they

[Speaker 3]: were doing something very

[Speaker 3]: counter social and and interest,

[Speaker 3]: But

[Speaker 3]: the

[Speaker 3]: even in The US,

[Speaker 3]: where people

[Speaker 3]: couldn't make a formula themselves, if they

[Speaker 3]: really couldn't produce milk,

[Speaker 3]: they could

[Speaker 3]: simply make a formula based on cow milk.

[Speaker 3]: And

[Speaker 3]: when it isn't

[Speaker 3]: dehydrated,

[Speaker 3]: the reaction on the immune system

[Speaker 3]: is less less harmful.

[Speaker 3]: To take take a

[Speaker 3]: a nonhuman milk

[Speaker 3]: and introduce it

[Speaker 3]: right at the very beginning

[Speaker 3]: will cause some

[Speaker 3]: endogenic differences, but

[Speaker 3]: at least if it's made from fresh

[Speaker 3]: cow milk.

[Speaker 3]: That's a lot safer than

[Speaker 3]: dehydrating because

[Speaker 3]: every time you dehydrate

[Speaker 3]: a living substance,

[Speaker 3]: you kill it and oxidize some of the

[Speaker 3]: proteins,

[Speaker 3]: amino acids,

[Speaker 3]: and especially the fatty acids.

[Speaker 3]: The cholesterol

[Speaker 3]: is oxidized.

[Speaker 3]: That's

[Speaker 3]: really only

[Speaker 3]: one of the fairly,

[Speaker 3]: trivial

[Speaker 3]: problems of dehydrated milk.

[Speaker 3]: It's the cholesterol is

[Speaker 3]: is damaged and made toxic,

[Speaker 3]: but many, many other components

[Speaker 3]: of the milk

[Speaker 3]: are susceptible

[Speaker 3]: to oxidative damage.

[Speaker 3]: There is a whole

[Speaker 3]: anti

[Speaker 3]: science that has grown up

[Speaker 3]: to defend

[Speaker 3]: the

[Speaker 3]: industry's

[Speaker 3]: use,

[Speaker 3]: not only of dehydrated

[Speaker 3]: milk,

[Speaker 3]: but

[Speaker 3]: of the

[Speaker 3]: added

[Speaker 3]: polyunsaturated

[Speaker 3]: fatty acids,

[Speaker 3]: which is it's really a separate issue

[Speaker 3]: because

[Speaker 3]: they argue that

[Speaker 3]: human milk

[Speaker 3]: contained more PUFA

[Speaker 3]: than cow milk.

[Speaker 3]: And

[Speaker 3]: so

[Speaker 3]: that has been a separate industry to say that

[Speaker 3]: the

[Speaker 3]: baby must be given a supplement

[Speaker 3]: of

[Speaker 3]: n minus three fatty acids

[Speaker 3]: because,

[Speaker 3]: they they say,

[Speaker 3]: almost all babies

[Speaker 3]: at birth

[Speaker 3]: have evidence

[Speaker 3]: of a deficiency

[Speaker 3]: of n minus three

[Speaker 2]: fatty acids. And that's because the placenta has filtered it out.

[Speaker 3]: Yeah. Exactly.

[Speaker 3]: It is recognized

[Speaker 3]: as something to

[Speaker 3]: be excluded

[Speaker 3]: during pregnancy.

[Speaker 3]: And

[Speaker 3]: but they refer that and say you need to

[Speaker 3]: supplement

[Speaker 3]: everyone because everyone is deficient.

[Speaker 2]: Because the body naturally tries

[Speaker 2]: to keep it away from the baby. You're deficient. That's just the rationale is insane.

[Speaker 3]: And they extend that to say that

[Speaker 3]: the aged brain

[Speaker 3]: contains

[Speaker 3]: increased amounts

[Speaker 3]: of n minus three PUFA.

[Speaker 3]: And so

[Speaker 3]: they

[Speaker 3]: they are wanting to say that

[Speaker 3]: because you find it

[Speaker 3]: in the old brain,

[Speaker 3]: that means it should be there.

[Speaker 3]: But,

[Speaker 3]: meanwhile,

[Speaker 3]: the old brain

[Speaker 3]: has deteriorated

[Speaker 3]: in proportion

[Speaker 3]: to

[Speaker 3]: the reduction

[Speaker 3]: of mitochondrial

[Speaker 3]: energy production,

[Speaker 3]: and that reduction

[Speaker 3]: corresponds

[Speaker 3]: to

[Speaker 3]: the increased presence

[Speaker 3]: of m minus three PUFA in the brain. So at every point, they've

[Speaker 3]: twisted the science,

[Speaker 3]: and one of the ways they twist it

[Speaker 3]: is with a certain,

[Speaker 3]: test of

[Speaker 3]: retinal responsiveness

[Speaker 3]: to electrical stimulation.

[Speaker 3]: And

[Speaker 3]: they say

[Speaker 3]: if you increase that

[Speaker 3]: with your added proof of it, you're going

[Speaker 3]: to show that

[Speaker 3]: that addition makes the

[Speaker 3]: eye develop faster

[Speaker 3]: and

[Speaker 3]: the brain developing

[Speaker 3]: its mental ability sooner.

[Speaker 3]: But that that is all just,

[Speaker 3]: fantasy

[Speaker 3]: speculation.

[Speaker 1]: Okay.

[Speaker 1]: We got a call that came in. Apparently the caller wanted to ask a question off the air. So

[Speaker 1]: before we go to this next question,

[Speaker 1]: the lines are open 7079233911

[Speaker 1]: is the number to call.

[Speaker 0]: So okay. What was the question that was being asked? So the caller wanted to know if you could talk about some good things for menopause such as,

[Speaker 0]: she's having brain fog and nausea.

[Speaker 2]: Well, ginger is always great for nausea.

[Speaker 1]: Brain

[Speaker 1]: fog. Okay. So good

[Speaker 1]: new nootropics.

[Speaker 1]: I don't know how supportive you are of nootropics outside of

[Speaker 1]: using anti stress

[Speaker 1]: substances like pregnenolone

[Speaker 1]: for decreasing

[Speaker 1]: cortisol and for decreasing inflammation.

[Speaker 1]: But what would your response to that be?

[Speaker 3]: Oh, yeah.

[Speaker 3]: All of those things,

[Speaker 3]: coffee,

[Speaker 3]: for example,

[Speaker 3]: aspirin,

[Speaker 3]: things that

[Speaker 3]: promote,

[Speaker 3]: mitochondrial

[Speaker 3]: oxidative

[Speaker 3]: use.

[Speaker 1]: Okay. Sugar.

[Speaker 1]: And herbal

[Speaker 2]: support would be Vitex,

[Speaker 2]: Chase Treeberry and Black Cohosh. Those are very effective at helping

[Speaker 2]: mitigate the menopausal symptoms.

[Speaker 1]: Okay. So, let's go on to the next question. I don't know if you've finished the milk.

[Speaker 2]: Yeah. Doctor. Wee, I wanted to ask a

[Speaker 2]: question about the milk. So all baby formula is dehydrated

[Speaker 2]: milk or dehydrated. Let's just say it's all dehydrated.

[Speaker 2]: So when you say make a formula out of milk,

[Speaker 2]: would you suggest adding anything to cow milk?

[Speaker 2]: Fresh cow milk?

[Speaker 3]: Yeah. You can

[Speaker 3]: adjust the amount

[Speaker 3]: of of fat and water

[Speaker 3]: if

[Speaker 3]: if

[Speaker 3]: it makes it

[Speaker 3]: more palatable

[Speaker 3]: to the baby,

[Speaker 3]: But,

[Speaker 3]: just as is,

[Speaker 3]: it'll work.

[Speaker 2]: And so what about this,

[Speaker 2]: talk in the news of

[Speaker 2]: a synthetic

[Speaker 2]: breast milk?

[Speaker 2]: What do you think of that? Oh, it definitely works.

[Speaker 2]: Do you think that would be preferable to cow's milk for babies?

[Speaker 3]: Or Oh, oh, sure. Yeah. That's

[Speaker 3]: The human well,

[Speaker 3]: assuming that

[Speaker 3]: the mother is eating

[Speaker 3]: properly

[Speaker 3]: because

[Speaker 3]: the human

[Speaker 3]: milk

[Speaker 3]: reflects

[Speaker 3]: the human diet

[Speaker 3]: because we don't have a rumen.

[Speaker 3]: The cow can eat

[Speaker 3]: grass and weeds

[Speaker 3]: and quite a lot of polyunsaturated

[Speaker 3]: fats

[Speaker 3]: and detoxifies

[Speaker 3]: them

[Speaker 3]: in the rumen.

[Speaker 3]: So

[Speaker 3]: as a rule,

[Speaker 3]: you

[Speaker 3]: can say that if the woman is

[Speaker 3]: eating well, then her milk is

[Speaker 3]: gonna be better than cow's milk.

[Speaker 2]: Right. But so what the question I was asking is, of course, we all know that

[Speaker 2]: mama's milk, breast milk is preferable for a baby or the best, but,

[Speaker 2]: with a healthy diet. But I've read about

[Speaker 2]: the making

[Speaker 2]: breast milk in a laboratory,

[Speaker 2]: trying to synthesize breast milk in a lab.

[Speaker 2]: I was wondering what your thoughts were on that.

[Speaker 3]: Well Probably not good. Might have a certain similarities

[Speaker 3]: to breast milk, but

[Speaker 3]: It's definitely going to be a

[Speaker 3]: synthetic

[Speaker 3]: material.

[Speaker 2]: Chemical.

[Speaker 1]: What

[Speaker 1]: about the subject of artificial

[Speaker 1]: meat?

[Speaker 1]: And again,

[Speaker 1]: between milk and meat and

[Speaker 1]: canceling out

[Speaker 1]: substances like sugar,

[Speaker 1]: they must say they, who are they, but the industry

[Speaker 1]: and whoever's behind the industry

[Speaker 1]: is seeking, I think, to

[Speaker 1]: separate people from their natural world. And I'm not saying, oh, everyone needs to drink milk. But I am saying that milk is an extremely good food. And I think there's so much evidence to support its use

[Speaker 1]: that the whole demonization of it is really the same kind of skewing the information that you're getting that you've given previous examples of

[Speaker 1]: in research.

[Speaker 1]: You've mentioned recently about

[Speaker 1]: protein intake for older people necessarily needing to be decreased and that's not a bad thing.

[Speaker 1]: So what about that in terms of

[Speaker 1]: the amount of

[Speaker 1]: you've never been big

[Speaker 1]: on muscle meat per se. You've always

[Speaker 1]: encouraged people to use the whole animal

[Speaker 1]: getting the gelatin

[Speaker 1]: from making a broth, for example, chicken or knuckle bones or you know, lamb shank?

[Speaker 3]: Yeah, yeah. For many years people have been

[Speaker 3]: aware that with aging,

[Speaker 3]: the metabolic rate slows down.

[Speaker 3]: And, Brode Barnes

[Speaker 3]: was thinking about that and

[Speaker 3]: the importance of the metabolic

[Speaker 3]: rate.

[Speaker 3]: And he had been using a supplement

[Speaker 3]: of, I think, two grains of

[Speaker 3]: armored

[Speaker 3]: thyroid,

[Speaker 3]: and he decided

[Speaker 3]: to go on a high protein diet

[Speaker 3]: when he was

[Speaker 3]: around 60, I think,

[Speaker 3]: and

[Speaker 3]: found that

[Speaker 3]: he had to

[Speaker 3]: double

[Speaker 3]: his dose of thyroid hormone,

[Speaker 3]: to to maintain his

[Speaker 3]: functioning,

[Speaker 3]: showing that

[Speaker 3]: the,

[Speaker 3]: for for an older person,

[Speaker 3]: what seems to be

[Speaker 3]: a

[Speaker 3]: good level

[Speaker 3]: of protein

[Speaker 3]: can can actually be

[Speaker 3]: very powerfully suppressive

[Speaker 3]: to your thyroid function.

[Speaker 1]: Okay. So

[Speaker 1]: we've talked about things like soy protein in the past being used

[Speaker 1]: as a meat alternative.

[Speaker 1]: We know that's definitely not a

[Speaker 1]: beneficial substance in terms of

[Speaker 1]: it raising estrogen

[Speaker 1]: in men and women and being

[Speaker 1]: relatively inflammatory

[Speaker 1]: in its own right.

[Speaker 1]: So

[Speaker 1]: I think and it's just part and parcel of our human human nature. And I think this really,

[Speaker 1]: for me, it's kind of speaking to

[Speaker 1]: the

[Speaker 1]: buyer beware

[Speaker 1]: mentality that I think everyone needs to try and hang on to and remember

[Speaker 1]: because I

[Speaker 1]: think,

[Speaker 1]: you know, it's just like social media and technology.

[Speaker 1]: We're kind of

[Speaker 1]: cajoled and lured into this kind of seemingly fuzzy world of

[Speaker 1]: comfortable technology.

[Speaker 1]: And we're really just sucking down so much poison that I think it's like being on drugs that are completely

[Speaker 1]: separating you from reality

[Speaker 1]: in terms of what's actually going on around you that you don't say anything and you're just

[Speaker 1]: cajoled and fuzzily, oh, it's okay if the government knows what they're doing. This COVID vaccine's a good thing. It saves lives. What are you talking about? You're the crazy one.

[Speaker 1]: I'll bring that subject back out in a moment here, but we do have another caller on the air. So,

[Speaker 1]: let's take this next caller. The caller, where are you from? What's your question?

[Speaker 4]: I'm from the Arcadia area.

[Speaker 4]: I just wanted to make a comment

[Speaker 4]: kind of looking at the general trend

[Speaker 4]: of things in this country where,

[Speaker 4]: you know, big corporations are wanna control

[Speaker 4]: everything,

[Speaker 4]: or at least

[Speaker 4]: the bulk of the economy.

[Speaker 4]: So it had to do with,

[Speaker 4]: seeds, basically.

[Speaker 4]: You guys were talking about

[Speaker 4]: food and growing organic vegetables and stuff like that, and

[Speaker 4]: I I was surprised talking to one of the vendors at the farmer's market,

[Speaker 4]: that she had to

[Speaker 4]: buy seeds.

[Speaker 4]: I don't know if it's some kind of licensed type of thing,

[Speaker 4]: but,

[Speaker 4]: just looking at the trend of how things are

[Speaker 4]: evolving,

[Speaker 4]: I would expect that over time,

[Speaker 4]: you know, the seed

[Speaker 4]: supply

[Speaker 4]: is going to be controlled by completely controlled or mostly controlled by big companies and it would behoove people to learn how to

[Speaker 4]: make their own seed,

[Speaker 4]: you know, grow their own seed, save seed and

[Speaker 4]: try to keep it

[Speaker 4]: from being contaminated

[Speaker 4]: with, I'm sure,

[Speaker 4]: genes that are gonna be inserted to

[Speaker 4]: either, you know, naked so you could only grow

[Speaker 4]: seed and it won't reproduce or what have you. So I guess that was my comment just

[Speaker 4]: moving forward. That's a good thing for people to try to explore.

[Speaker 2]: Thank you for your show. Yes, you're welcome. Thank you for your call.

[Speaker 1]: Okay, yes. And then I want to just kind of round follow-up

[Speaker 1]: that caller with this really applies to people that are fortunate enough

[Speaker 1]: to have a garden.

[Speaker 1]: I'm not talking about acres of land, but I'm just talking about people that have a small

[Speaker 1]: garden to grow vegetables in because

[Speaker 1]: obviously, you know, and we've all known it, and it's happened in China,

[Speaker 1]: quite successfully, where millions and millions upon hundreds of millions of people were pulled out of rural agrarian

[Speaker 1]: locations and brought to the cities.

[Speaker 1]: It's all about the cities and it's all about the mass media control they have over populations when you're in the cities and under their domain and you don't have a garden and you don't have a connection to the natural world. That's when all of this is breaking down. That's,

[Speaker 1]: I think, very,

[Speaker 1]: very similar to,

[Speaker 1]: you know, some of the kind of biblical references

[Speaker 1]: to that very same subject and like the Tower Of Babel

[Speaker 1]: and how all of this was just a massive confusion. And,

[Speaker 1]: you know,

[Speaker 1]: God made it impossible for them to understand each other.

[Speaker 1]: And that was because they just wanted to get on with it without God. And they didn't feel they needed any kind of natural creation they could do without do without all of that. And I think, unfortunately, it's a kind of side effect of our humanism

[Speaker 1]: that, you know, we don't, you know, we're kind of numbed. And I think so many people, unfortunately,

[Speaker 1]: are just sucking it down, you know. And,

[Speaker 1]: yeah, I find it hard to find it hard to believe in some ways that they're pulling it off. But I think what's happening really is a concerted and orchestrated

[Speaker 1]: attempt.

[Speaker 1]: And we're not even attempt. I think they're doing it. It's an orchestrated

[Speaker 1]: play, and we're going through the motions. But I'd never give up. And I would encourage everybody listening never to give up. They're never as far as I'm concerned, they're never gonna win. You just have to keep resisting and keep resisting for the very end because the end is not the end.

[Speaker 1]: Okay?

[Speaker 1]: So, yeah, Doctor. P, again, like you've been around quite a while now and you've seen governments come and go and heads of state come and go and you've seen lots of headlines and

[Speaker 1]: politics etcetera.

[Speaker 1]: I don't know, I'll just ask you in these last few closing moments about your impression.

[Speaker 1]: Yes, is there any hope? Of the world. What do you think about it? I mean, I know we're

[Speaker 1]: still alive and we're still

[Speaker 1]: trying to do the right thing, but,

[Speaker 1]: where

[Speaker 1]: are you with all of this?

[Speaker 3]: I'm still hopeful.

[Speaker 1]: Good.

[Speaker 3]: Like

[Speaker 3]: Rainer Fjolnir

[Speaker 3]: said, we have

[Speaker 3]: to do everything

[Speaker 3]: legal and impossible

[Speaker 3]: to try to prosecute these people.

[Speaker 3]: But at some point,

[Speaker 3]: he's

[Speaker 3]: going to

[Speaker 3]: count on

[Speaker 3]: some kind of a cosmic bailout

[Speaker 3]: for us.

[Speaker 2]: Wait. Wait.

[Speaker 2]: Reiner is counting on a cosmic bailout?

[Speaker 3]: Yeah. I forgot his exact phrase, but

[Speaker 3]: Interesting. He said

[Speaker 3]: he couldn't

[Speaker 3]: explain it rationally, but

[Speaker 3]: he had this confidence that

[Speaker 3]: the universe wasn't going to let that turn out the way the World Economic

[Speaker 3]: Federation hopes.

[Speaker 2]: Or the IMF.

[Speaker 1]: Okay. Well Well, that's hopeful. There's hope then. Yeah. Well, good.

[Speaker 1]: I appreciate your time, joining us on the show.

[Speaker 1]: And, only

[Speaker 1]: sad that we didn't have more callers, but I can only hope that people It's a busy weekend. People have rodeo

[Speaker 1]: and the summer arts fair and That's local. I can only hope that people are listening Oysterfest. Listening and not calling in. But like I always say,

[Speaker 1]: the archive is there for people to listen to in the future

[Speaker 1]: and the future will vindicate

[Speaker 1]: what you've said for a long time. So thanks so much again Doctor. Pete for joining us. Okay. Thank you. Thank you and good night. Bye. Okay. So I just wanted to kind of finish off with saying that this connection is undoubtable

[Speaker 1]: between technocracy

[Speaker 1]: and dehumanization

[Speaker 1]: through lockdowns and social isolation.

[Speaker 1]: So with government coercive measures and Soviet era style social control where individuals are set against individuals similar also to the brown shirts of Nazi Germany, the Orwellian reality we are now in, and which, unless it's resisted, will become de facto the new normal,

[Speaker 1]: and must be resisted vehemently through peaceful protests and political involvement

[Speaker 1]: on the state and local level needs to occur. And it's the reason we need another Hague in charges of international war crimes against humanity where the guilty are charged and why Reiner Formik's group in Germany

[Speaker 1]: is at this very moment pressing these charges.

[Speaker 1]: So the thing is ongoing.

[Speaker 1]: I like to think that there is a real justice

[Speaker 1]: and that we're not just going to be

[Speaker 1]: sucked into the matrix.

[Speaker 1]: We're not going to have

[Speaker 1]: any way through it. So do you say there's someone else who wanted to ask a question? Well, I think Doctor. Pete is probably hung up by now anyway.

[Speaker 1]: Hello? Yeah, go ahead. We've got three minutes as well till the top of the hour. Okay, a couple of things.

[Speaker 5]: One is

[Speaker 1]: the, I don't even think we've got time. We've got three minutes. It's not gonna happen.

[Speaker 1]: I'm so

[Speaker 5]: sorry. Okay. We better

[Speaker 5]: call this it because I will run over and So basically, I want to know okay. They say that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure and you seem to think that

[Speaker 5]: getting some kind of treatment is better than getting a vaccine to prevent the COVID.

[Speaker 5]: And, you know, I I would rather not get it than have to, you know, get it and be treated for it.

[Speaker 5]: But so I'd like to an answer to that question

[Speaker 5]: and also basically why do you think

[Speaker 5]: that the vaccine is worse for you than the COVID itself?

[Speaker 1]: The information is out there for anybody who wants to search for it. So it's not something you're gonna see on your Facebook group or on your YouTube channel. Or Google or the fact checkers that check that work for Google. And it is two minutes at the top of the hour. So I need to give credit to Doctor. Pete and his website and his information. So

[Speaker 1]: I appreciate your call, but don't have time to answer it. I'm sorry.

[Speaker 1]: So, okay. For those of you who've listened to the show, they run every third Friday of the month from seven to 8PM.

[Speaker 1]: We'll be back in July.

[Speaker 1]: We're coming up to the solstice now. So,

[Speaker 1]: we run a business called Western Botanical Medicine. And Doctor. Raymond Pete, his website is raypeat,

[Speaker 1]: raypeat.com.

[Speaker 1]: And he has got plenty of scientific

[Speaker 1]: reference articles that are not his opinion,

[Speaker 1]: but are pulled from

[Speaker 1]: current medical journals or past medical journals, medical research,

[Speaker 1]: trials, etcetera, etcetera.

[Speaker 1]: And again, may not be something that you'll find on your Facebook group,

[Speaker 1]: or if you just Google it, up until this point, you're probably not going to find it and some of it's going to be censored. And we're probably moving into a more censored environment as we go on folks. So people just watch out, you know.

[Speaker 1]: Anyway, without being alarmist about it, my name is Andrew Murray and we'll talk to you again in July. My name is Sarah Johannessen Murray. Thank you for listening.
